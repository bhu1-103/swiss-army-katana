## Featured Projects

### [Sasta-ChatGPT](https://github.com/bhu1-103/swiss-army-katana/tree/main/sasta-chatgpt)
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool that uses a local LLM (via Ollama) to answer questions about a given knowledge base. It fetches content from sources like Wikipedia, processes it, and uses a sentence-transformer model to find relevant context for the user's query.

### [Graphics Programming with OpenGL](https://github.com/bhu1-103/swiss-army-katana/tree/main/opengl)
This directory contains various experiments with OpenGL, including a **Doom-like 3D engine** that uses 2D ray casting to render a 3D perspective, a series of **Synthwave-style animations**, and other smaller graphical projects.

### [Maze Generator & Solver](https://github.com/bhu1-103/swiss-army-katana/tree/main/maze)
A Python script that uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to generate complex mazes. It also includes a solver that uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path from the start to the end, verifying that each generated maze is solvable.

### [Game Prototyping in TIC-80](https://github.com/bhu1-103/swiss-army-katana/tree/main/tic-80)
A collection of game mechanics experiments developed for the TIC-80 fantasy console. These projects focus on implementing core platformer physics, including refined jump mechanics, gravity, and sprite wrapping.

### [Voice Assistant](https://github.com/bhu1-103/swiss-army-katana/tree/main/assistant)
A simple voice assistant built with a shell script. It uses `ffmpeg` for audio capture and the `vosk-transcriber` library for speech-to-text, allowing it to perform basic commands like opening applications.

## Scripts & Utilities
This repository also contains a variety of smaller scripts and tools to automate tasks, including:
- **[PDF to Audiobook](https://github.com/bhu1-103/swiss-army-katana/tree/main/tools/pdf2audiobook):** A set of scripts that convert PDF files into audiobooks by extracting text, cleaning it, and using a text-to-speech engine.
- **[np](https://github.com/bhu1-103/swiss-army-katana/tree/main/tools/template-handler):** A script to quickly scaffold new C++ projects from templates.
- **[auto-rotate](https://github.com/bhu1-103/swiss-army-katana/tree/main/tools/auto-rotate):** A script for enabling automatic screen rotation on laptops with accelerometers.

## [Dotfiles](https://github.com/bhu1-103/swiss-army-katana/tree/main/dotfiles)
My personal configuration files for various tools and window managers like Hyprland, bspwm, and i3.

## hosted my n8n dashboard using docker and cloudflared
