# home lab setup to practice

install qemu-full (just in case, but qemu-base should do good)

pull void linux iso using wget -> run setup.sh

run boot.sh

open terminal in void linux, run `sudo void-install`

follow installation instructions and you should be good

do not assign a filesystem for /boot tho, just leave it as it is

jellyfin server -> `watch.bhu1.xyz`

n8n server -> `n8n.bhu1.xyz`
