# a few hacks i used to get custom models on imx500 running

## Jan-18-2026

### code thinks i am not running it on a raspberry pi 

nvim /home/bhu5/models/4-yolov8/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/modlib/devices/ai_camera/rpk_packager.python3

`       #if platform.system() != "Linux" or platform.machine() != "aarch64":`
`       #    raise EnvironmentError("This RPKPackager is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi.")`

### opencv installation was not happening in raspberry pi due to low storage

- but there was enough storage space.
- checked ram, opencv source package was 96 mb, too much for 512 mb raspberry pi zero 2 w.
- change temp directory location to somewhere in the sd card insetad of ram or swap space as it is limited there

`       export TMPDIR=~/tmp_build`

### sony's library needed a newer version of opencv

- bypass it entirely in the pyproject.toml file after cloning the repo
- comment out opencv from pyproject.toml as this just uses basic opencv stuff that doesn't change much and is not critical.

`       #"opencv-python>=4.10.0.84,<=4.12.0.88",`
