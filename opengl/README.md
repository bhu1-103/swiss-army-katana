# OpenGL Projects

This directory contains a collection of my experiments with graphics programming using OpenGL.

## Projects

### [Doom-Limited](doom-limited)
An experiment in creating a 3D-like environment using 2D ray casting, similar to the technique used in classic games like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. It takes a 2D map and renders a first-person perspective by casting rays from the player's position.

### [Synthwave](synthwave)
A series of projects focused on creating synthwave-inspired animated visuals. These projects explore 3D transformations, camera movement, and lighting to create a retro-futuristic aesthetic.

### [3D Cube](3d-cube)
A simple project to render a colored, spinning 3D cube. This was an early experiment to learn the fundamentals of 3D rendering in OpenGL.

### [Zelda: A Link to the Past](zelda-link-to-the-past)
A small project attempting to recreate elements from the classic SNES game, *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past*, in a 3D environment.
