         The Boy: When the Heart Doesn't Speak


                                 Prologue

The world outside the café window was blurred by the soft drizzle of rain, the
kind that didn’t quite wash away the weight of the day, but softened it just
enough to breathe. The streets were slick with moisture, the usual hustle of
campus life muffled under the steady hum of tires on wet roads. Inside the café,
though, it was warm, almost too warm, with a kind of electric comfort that
made Rhea feel as if she were enclosed in a bubble, separate from the world.
She stirred her coffee absentmindedly, watching the swirls of cream mix into the
dark liquid. She liked it strong, and bold—just like her studies, her goals, the
path she had set for herself. No distractions. No complications. Just progress.
She had learned a long time ago that if you focused hard enough, you could shut
out the noise of everything else.
And that was exactly what she had been doing for the past few years of college.
The ambition to succeed, to rise above, had consumed her. There was no room
for anything else. Not friendships that might fade away, not love that felt like an
illusion, a fleeting emotion best left to novels and romantic comedies. Her life
was about building a future—no time for distractions.
But recently, something had been stirring inside her, a restlessness that had been
quietly growing for months. It was subtle at first—an idea that crossed her mind
when she was up late, scribbling notes in her journal, her fingers covered in ink
as her thoughts spilled onto the page. Then, it turned into a drive. The urge to
write a book had become an obsession.
Her phone buzzed on the table, pulling her away from her thoughts. The screen
flashed with the name Ananya in bold letters. Rhea smiled softly, always
grateful for Ananya’s vibrant energy, even if it wasn’t something she always
understood. Ananya had a way of throwing herself into life, her heart fully open,
her emotions on her sleeve. She was everything Rhea wasn’t.
Ananya (text): “Café, as usual? We need to talk.”

Rhea typed back, her fingers moving quickly as if she could already predict
what the conversation would be about. She and Ananya had spent hours
discussing everything from boys to grades, from dreams to disappointments
along with a few other friends. It wasn’t that Rhea didn’t like it—she just wasn’t
as vocal about her feelings. She kept them tucked away, buried deep inside,
where no one could see them.
Rhea (texting back): “On my way.”
She stood up from the small table, grabbing her jacket from the back of her
chair. The café was bustling with students, but Rhea felt removed from it all.
She was a part of the crowd, yet she stood on the edges, observing without
really participating. As she made her way out the door, the rain seemed to greet
her like an old friend, drizzling on her face as she walked toward the café.
The campus was as vibrant as always, with the usual mix of people walking
across the quad, chattering, laughing, and rushing to classes. It was funny, she
thought, how everyone had a place in the world, a way of fitting in, except for
her. She wasn’t an outcast, not by any means. She had friends, her circle, her
routine. But somewhere, deep down, she felt like she was watching life unfold
through a glass window. She wasn’t a part of it, just a silent observer.
As she neared the café, she spotted Ananya sitting with Meera, Priya, and her
best friend Nina her loud voice cutting through the hum of the surrounding
conversation. Rhea smiled slightly at the sight. Ananya always knew how to fill
a room, and how to make everyone feel like they were part of something. It was
something Rhea admired in her, even if she never said it out loud.
Ananya (grinning as Rhea approached): “There you are! I’ve been waiting for
you, and you know I don’t like waiting.”
Rhea rolled her eyes affectionately as she sat down.
Meera (teasing): “You’re always late, Rhea. If you didn’t spend so much time
overthinking everything, you’d probably have more time to hang out.”
Rhea (smiling but not really responding): “I wasn’t overthinking. I was just...
thinking. A lot of things on my plate.”
Ananya (sipping her coffee): “Yeah, like what’s next in your life? You’re too
focused on the future to even enjoy the present. You need to relax sometimes.”

Rhea gave a small, amused smile. Ananya was always pushing for the next
adventure, the next experience, while Rhea was more grounded in the present,
tethered by her expectations.
Rhea (shrugging): “I’m fine, Ananya. Really. I’m just—focusing.”
Ananya raised an eyebrow, her lips curling into a playful grin. “Focusing? Or
avoiding?”
Before Rhea could respond, Priya leaned in a thoughtful expression on her face.
Priya: “Have you ever thought about letting go, Rhea? Just... being?”
Rhea met Priya’s gaze, her heart tightening. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to be,
but the truth was that Rhea didn’t know how to just be. She had spent so much
time trying to prove herself—academic excellence, perfection in everything—
that the idea of being carefree, of letting her emotions spill out, seemed foreign
to her.
Rhea (softly): “I guess... I don’t know how.”
Ananya sighed, shaking her head. “Rhea, you don’t have to have everything
figured out. You don’t have to be perfect all the time.”
Rhea (internally): But I do. I need to be. It’s the only thing I know.
Nina (leaning back with a thoughtful smile): “You know, Rhea, it’s okay to not
have all the answers. Nobody does. Sometimes, life is about figuring it out as
you go.”
Rhea looked at Nina, appreciating the gentle understanding in her voice. Nina
had always been the calm one, the steady presence that balanced out Ananya’s
energy and Priya’s introspection.
Rhea (sighing): “Maybe, but it’s easier said than done, Nina. I feel like if I don’t
plan everything, I might lose control.”
Nina (softly, but firmly): “Control isn’t everything, Rhea. Sometimes, letting go
gives you more clarity than holding on. You’ve come this far—trust yourself a
little.”
Rhea (after a pause, smiling slightly): “Trust myself, huh? I guess that’s
something I need to work on.”

Nina nodded with a reassuring smile, and Ananya, unable to stay quiet for long,
jumped back in.
Ananya (grinning): “Exactly! And if trusting yourself doesn’t work, just trust
me. I’ve got great instincts!”
The group burst into laughter, the tension in the air dissolving as Rhea allowed
herself to relax, even if just for a moment.


Her friends didn’t understand, but that was okay. They lived in the now,
jumping from one thing to the next without hesitation. Rhea had never been able
to do that. She was always looking ahead, always planning for something bigger.
For her, it was never about the present. It was about what came next.
She took a deep breath, pushing the thoughts aside. The girls were talking about
their latest crushes and their ever-changing social lives, and Rhea listened with a
detached sort of amusement. She smiled when it was expected, and nodded
when necessary, but she couldn’t help feeling like an outsider in their world of
fleeting connections. They were always looking for something, someone, to fill
the gaps in their lives.
But Rhea wasn’t sure she believed in that kind of love. The kind that was
reckless, untamed, the kind that consumed you and left you lost. She wasn’t
sure she was ready for it.
What if love wasn’t a whirlwind? What if it was something quieter, more subtle,
something that didn’t demand to be noticed?
The thought made her pause. But it wasn’t something she was ready to explore.
Not yet.
As she looked around at her friends, she realized that maybe, just maybe, they
were right. Maybe she did need to open up. But it was easier said than done.
Rhea wasn’t sure she wanted to risk the vulnerability that came with letting go.


Ananya (brightly): “So, you know what, Rhea? You’ve been talking about
writing a book forever. Why don’t you just—do it?”

Rhea’s hand froze mid-sip, her mind racing. She had written bits and pieces,
jotted down notes, stories, and reflections—but the idea of actually completing
a book, publishing it... it felt too overwhelming. Too real.
Rhea (nervously): “I don’t know... I mean, I haven’t even finished anything
yet.”
Priya (with a knowing smile): “But you’ve been working on it, right? You’ve
been writing non-stop for months. It’s all just waiting to come together.”
Ananya leaned forward eagerly. “Exactly! You’ve got this. You just need to stop
waiting for the right time. There’s never a right time. Just... make it happen.”
Rhea felt a small flicker of excitement at the thought. She had always been
drawn to writing, the escape of it, the ability to create worlds with words. But
every time she thought about completing it, she hesitated. Would anyone care?
Would it even be good enough?
But then she thought about it again. What if it was? What if she didn’t need
permission from anyone but herself?
Rhea (determined): “I will. I’ll do it. I’ll finish it.”
Ananya clapped her hands together, grinning. “Yes! That’s the Rhea I know!”

                   Chapter 1: Rhea’s Escape

Scene 1: The Beginning of a New Chapter
“94 percent!” Rhea’s voice echoed through the house, her excitement ringing
clear. She stared at the screen, her results glowing back at her as if validating all
her sleepless nights and relentless effort. For a moment, she could barely
breathe, overwhelmed by the weight of what she’d just achieved.
Her parents, sitting on the couch nearby, exchanged proud smiles. Her father
patted her shoulder, his quiet pride evident, while her mother, overwhelmed
with emotion, wrapped her in a warm hug.
“This is your ticket out of here,” her mother whispered, her voice trembling
with a mix of relief and happiness.
Rhea smiled, her heart swelling with determination. This wasn’t just about
marks or admissions—it was about leaving behind a chapter of her life she
couldn’t wait to close.
Her father adjusted his glasses, glancing at the screen. “You’ve done us proud,
Rhea. Now it’s time to start dreaming big.”
Rhea nodded but said nothing. In her mind, she was already visualizing the
future: a new college, new friends, and a chance to reinvent herself.




Scene 2: The Junior College Experience
The thought of leaving her old college brought back a rush of memories, none
of which she was eager to revisit. Her first day at her 11th-grade campus was
nothing like what she’d imagined. She’d entered with hopes of finding a
supportive environment and maybe, just maybe, a close-knit group of friends.
But reality had been far harsher.
The college hallways had been a battleground of cliques, gossip, and silent
competitions. The so-called "popular group" had dominated every corridor, and
anyone who didn’t fit their mold was invisible. Rhea, with her quiet demeanor
and focus on academics, had been an easy target.

One memory stood out distinctly:
“Hey, Rhea!” a girl from her class had called out once during lunch.
Rhea had turned, surprised to hear her name. “Yes?”
“Can you help me with this assignment?” the girl had asked sweetly, but Rhea
noticed the barely hidden smirk on her face. Before she could respond, another
girl chimed in, “Yeah, you’re the topper, right? Surely you don’t mind doing it
for us.”
Rhea hesitated. She wanted to be helpful, but their tone made her uncomfortable.
“I can explain it to you,” she had replied politely, clutching her books tighter.
The smirks turned to sneers. “Wow, you’re no fun,” one of them said, and they
walked away, laughing.




Scene 3: Fake Relationships and Drama
The drama in her old college had been endless, and most of it revolved around
the so-called "love stories" that unfolded like TV soap operas. Couples would
announce their relationships with much fanfare, only to break up a week later
over petty misunderstandings.
Rhea often found herself an unwilling witness to these theatrics. During one
business studies lecture, a couple seated behind her began arguing in hushed but
clearly audible tones.
“Why didn’t you reply to my text?” the boy hissed.
“I was busy studying!” the girl snapped back.
“Busy? Or were you talking to Harsh again?”
Rhea rolled her eyes and tried to focus on the World Map table in front of her.
The irony wasn’t lost on her—she was surrounded by so much noise about love
and relationships, yet she had never experienced any of it herself.

Scene 4: Isolation and Longing
The hardest part about her old college wasn’t the drama or the gossip—it was
the loneliness. Rhea had tried, in her own quiet way, to make friends, but the
connections always felt superficial.
One afternoon, as she sat alone in the library, she overheard a group of
classmates talking nearby.
“Did you see Rhea’s score on the last test? She’s such a nerd,” one of them said.
“Yeah, but she’s so boring. She never talks to anyone,” another added.
Rhea felt a pang of hurt but forced herself to focus on her book. “This isn’t
forever,” she thought. “I just need to get through these two years.”




Scene 5: The SOS Dream
The next day, after receiving her results, Rhea sat in her room, a wave of relief
washing over her. She had made up her mind. The thought of not having to
return to the college she disliked was exhilarating. Her fingers hovered over the
keyboard as she pulled up the SOS University website, her excitement building.
She could already imagine a fresh start, away from the awkward encounters and
the suffocating atmosphere. It felt like the perfect time to take that leap, and she
was determined to apply.
The testimonials from students were like a beacon of hope. One of them read:
“SOS University isn’t just a place to study—it’s a place to grow, to find yourself,
and to build a future.”
Rhea stared at the pictures of smiling students on the campus lawn, imagining
herself among them. The sprawling greenery and vibrant campus life felt like
more than just a university—it felt like a space where dreams were nurtured.
She had always been fascinated by the workings of her country—its policies, its
economy, and the intricate dance of decisions that shaped lives. Economics,
with its ability to explain these systems, was a subject that had captured her
curiosity for years. But alongside this analytical side was her passion for words.
Rhea loved literature—writing had always been her escape, her way of
understanding and expressing the world around her.

SOS University, with its myriad of clubs and communities, promised the best of
both worlds. The academic rigor of economics would challenge her intellect,
while the creative writing clubs and literary societies would feed her soul.
“This is where I belong,” she thought, her heart swelling with a mix of hope and
determination. Without hesitation, she filled out the application form and hit
submit. For the first time in a while, the future didn’t seem as daunting—it felt
like a new story waiting to unfold.




Scene 6: A Glimpse of the Future
The next morning, Rhea sat with her parents at breakfast, the glow of her
achievement still fresh. She couldn’t keep the excitement bottled up any longer.
“I applied to SOS University last night,” she announced, her voice carrying a
mix of pride and anticipation.
Her father raised an eyebrow, a teasing smile tugging at his lips. “You didn’t
waste any time, did you?”
Rhea shook her head, her enthusiasm bubbling over. “I can’t wait any longer.
SOS is everything I’ve ever wanted. It’s a huge campus, Dad—vibrant, full of
opportunities. The kind of place where I can really find my footing.”
Her mother set down her cup of tea, a soft smile spreading across her face. “It’s
not going to be easy, you know. A new place means new people, new
challenges.”
“I’m ready,” Rhea said firmly, her eyes shining with determination. “They have
clubs for everything, Mom—economics forums, debate societies, and even
creative writing workshops! Imagine being surrounded by people who are just
as passionate as I am. It’s not just about studying; it’s about growing, about
exploring everything I’ve always dreamed of.”
Her father’s smile deepened as he leaned back in his chair. “You’ve thought this
through, haven’t you?”
Rhea nodded. “SOS isn’t just a university. It’s a community, a place where I can
learn how the world works while also having the space to write, to create. And
the campus—huge libraries, cultural festivals, open lawns where students can

just sit and brainstorm ideas. I’ve always wanted to be part of something big,
something meaningful.”
Her mother reached out, placing a hand over Rhea’s. “It sounds like you’ve
found your place.”
Rhea felt a lump rise in her throat at the warmth in her mother’s voice. “I want
to make you both proud. I want to grow into someone who can stand on her
own, who can make a difference.”
Her father gave her a nod of approval. “We’re already proud of you, Rhea. And
I think you’ve made the right choice. SOS sounds like it’ll challenge you, push
you to your limits, and that’s exactly what you need.”
Her mother added, her voice gentle yet firm, “And don’t forget to enjoy it. The
experiences, the friendships—they’ll shape you just as much as the lectures and
the books.”
For the first time in a long while, the breakfast table was filled with a sense of
excitement and hope. Rhea’s dream was no longer just a far-off vision; it was a
tangible path ahead, one that she was ready to walk with her parents’
unwavering support.

               Chapter 2: The Journey to SOS


Scene 1: The Announcement of Exams
It was a crisp morning when Rhea received the email from SOS University. She
skimmed through it, her heart pounding.
“Entrance Exam: Details Enclosed.”
She gasped and quickly opened the attachment. The exam was scheduled for
two weeks later, covering quantitative aptitude, general knowledge, logical
reasoning, and subject-based knowledge she had applied for. It wasn’t going to
be easy, but Rhea’s determination burned brighter than ever.
At breakfast, she shared the news with her parents.
Rhea: “I got the exam date! It’s in two weeks.”
Her father nodded, setting down his newspaper. “That’s great. Now you just
need to focus and prepare.”
Her mother, ever the worrier, looked concerned. “Two weeks doesn’t sound like
much time. Are you sure you can manage everything?”
Rhea (with a confident smile): “I’ve waited for this chance for so long. I’m not
letting it slip away.”




Scene 2: Preparation and Doubts
The next few days were a whirlwind of activity. Rhea immersed herself in
preparation, poring over aptitude books, solving reasoning problems, and
brushing up on current events.
Late one night, as she sat at her desk, exhausted but determined, her father
knocked on the door and entered.
Father: “How’s it going?”

11 | P a g e
12


Rhea sighed, setting down her pen. “It’s...a lot. But I think I’m getting there.”
Father: “Remember, Rhea, it’s not just about how much you study. It’s about
staying calm. Take breaks, okay?”
Rhea nodded, appreciating his support. But as soon as he left, doubt crept in.
“What if I’m not good enough? What if I mess this up?”
She shook her head, banishing the thoughts. “No, I’ve worked too hard for this.
I have to keep going.”




Scene 3: The Exam Day
The day of the exam arrived sooner than she had expected. Rhea stood outside
the exam center, her palms clammy with nervousness. She clutched her ID and
admit card tightly, glancing at the other candidates around her.
Her mother gave her a reassuring pat on the back.
Mother: “You’ve got this, Dear. Just do your best.”
Father: “And don’t forget to breathe,” he added with a smile.
Rhea managed a nod and a small smile before walking into the hall. The exam
papers were distributed, and as she turned the pages, her mind shifted into focus
mode.
Quantitative aptitude was her strongest section, and she breezed through it.
Logical reasoning required more effort, but she kept her cool. The essay, “The
Role of Innovation in Education,” was her chance to shine. She poured her
thoughts onto the paper, writing passionately about how education needed to
evolve to foster creativity and critical thinking.




Scene 4: Post-Exam Anxiety
After the exam, Rhea stepped out of the hall, feeling a mix of relief and
uncertainty. Her parents were waiting outside.
Mother: “How did it go?”


12 | P a g e
13


Rhea (shrugging): “I think it was okay. But the essay... I hope they like it.”
Father: “You’ve done your best. That’s all that matters.”
As they walked back to the car, Rhea couldn’t help but replay every question in
her mind, second-guessing her answers.




Scene 5: The Interview Call
A week later, the email arrived. Rhea read it three times before it sank in.
“Congratulations! You have been shortlisted for the interview round.”
Her parents were thrilled. Her father hugged her, and her mother’s eyes welled
up with tears.
Mother: “I knew you’d do it! Now you just have to ace the interview.”
Rhea’s excitement quickly gave way to nerves. She had no idea what to expect.




Scene 6: Preparing for the Interview
The days leading up to the interview were spent practicing. Her father acted as
the interviewer, throwing mock questions at her.
Father: “Why do you want to join SOS University?”
Rhea (nervously): “Um, because it’s a great college...”
Father (shaking his head): “That’s too vague. Be specific. Talk about your goals
and what SOS can offer you.”
Her mother chipped in with advice on posture and presentation.
Mother: “Sit up straight, smile, and don’t fidget.”
Rhea practiced tirelessly, rehearsing her answers until they felt natural.




13 | P a g e
14


Scene 7: The Interview Day
The day of the interview was a rollercoaster of emotions. Rhea sat in the
waiting room, her heart pounding as she watched other candidates go in and out.
Her parents sat nearby, offering quiet support.
When her name was called, Rhea took a deep breath and walked in. The panel
of interviewers greeted her warmly.
Interviewer 1: “Good morning, Rhea. Please, have a seat.”
She replied with a “Thank You Sir” and sat down, clasping her hands to steady
them.
Interviewer 2: “So, Rhea, why SOS University ?”
Rhea (with a smile): “I’ve always admired SOS for its emphasis on holistic
learning and innovation. I believe it’s the perfect place for me to grow
academically and personally.”
The questions ranged from her academic achievements to her views on global
issues.
Interviewer 3: “If you had to describe yourself in three words, what would they
be?”
Rhea (after a moment’s thought): “Determined, curious, and resilient.”
The final question took her by surprise.
Interviewer 1: “Where do you see yourself in five years?”
Rhea paused, then spoke from the heart. “I see myself contributing to the field
of economics in meaningful ways, perhaps working on policies that make a
difference. But more than that, I hope to be someone who’s constantly learning
and evolving.”
As the interview concluded, the panel smiled.
Interviewer 2: “Thank you, Rhea. That was insightful.”

Scene 8: The Waiting Game
Outside the admissions office, Rhea’s parents waited anxiously. Her mother
paced nervously, her fingers fiddling with her phone, while her father stood with
his arms crossed, trying to look calm but unable to hide the glimmer of concern
in his eyes. The air was thick with anticipation.
Mother (as Rhea emerged): “How was it? How did it go?”
Rhea smiled faintly, trying to mask the whirlwind of emotions swirling inside
her. “I think it went well. They smiled a lot, but I can’t be sure. They asked a lot
of questions about my goals, about my interests... but I never really know how
these things go.”
Her father stepped forward, a reassuring hand resting on her shoulder. “Well,
you’ve done your part. Now it’s in their hands. You can’t control what happens
next, but you’ve given it everything you had.”
Rhea nodded, grateful for their steady presence. As they headed to the car, the
drive home felt longer than usual. The rhythmic hum of the tires on the road
only added to the uncertainty in her mind. The silence in the car was
comfortable but heavy, filled with a mixture of relief and anticipation.
Mother (breaking the silence): “I know you’re nervous, but whatever happens,
we’re proud of you. Just remember, this isn’t the end of the road—it’s just one
step. We’ve seen you grow, and you’ll keep growing, no matter where you are.”
Rhea glanced out the window, watching the city pass by. The trees blurred into a
continuous line as she pondered her future. This moment felt like the calm
before the storm. She could almost feel the weight of all her efforts—the long
nights of studying, the doubts she had fought, the sacrifices she had made.
Father (with a knowing smile): “You’ve got this, Rhea. I can’t wait to see where
this journey takes you.”
Rhea couldn’t help but smile, despite the uncertainty. “I hope it’s somewhere
good,” she said quietly, her voice tinged with a mix of hope and fear.
As they pulled into their driveway, Rhea’s heart raced. The next few days felt
like a lifetime away. She wasn’t sure what the outcome would be, but she knew
one thing for sure—no matter the result, this was the beginning of something
much bigger. The waiting game had just begun.

               Chapter 3: The Moment of Triumph


Scene 1: The Waiting Ends
Rhea sat at her desk, staring at her laptop screen, refreshing her email inbox for
what felt like the hundredth time that day. Her heart raced every time the page
loaded. It had been three weeks since the interview, and every passing day had
only added to her anxiety.
Finally, a new email popped up. Her eyes widened as she saw the subject line:
"Congratulations! Admission to SOS University."
She clicked on it, her hands trembling. As she read the words confirming her
acceptance, tears welled up in her eyes.
Rhea (whispering to herself): “I did it. I actually did it!”
She rushed out of her room, shouting, “Mom! Dad! I got in!”




Scene 2: The Family’s Reaction
Her parents, who were in the living room, looked up in surprise.
Mother: “You got in? Really?”
Rhea (nodding, breathless): “Yes! They accepted me!”
Her father stood up, his face breaking into a proud smile.
Father: “I knew you could do it, Rhea. You’ve worked so hard for this.”
Her mother hugged her tightly, tears streaming down her face.
Mother: “I’m so proud of you. You deserve this.”
Father (teasing): “Now you’ll be leaving us for the big world, huh? SOS
University!”
Rhea laughed, wiping her own tears. “I’m going to make you both proud, I
promise.”


16 | P a g e
17


Scene 3: Sharing the News
The first person Rhea texted was a girl named Saumya from her pu college
whom she didn’t find acting good toward her
Rhea (text): “Guess what? I got into SOS University!”
Saumya (reply): “OMG! Congratulations, Rhea! I knew you’d do it. We need to
celebrate ASAP!”
Soon, her phone was buzzing with messages from relatives and a few
classmates who had heard the news through the grapevine.
Classmate 1: “Congrats, Rhea! SOS is amazing!”
Classmate 2: “Wow, Rhea, you’re going places! All the best!”
Rhea smiled at the messages, feeling a mix of pride and excitement.




Scene 4: The Celebratory Dinner
That evening, her parents decided to take her out for a celebratory dinner. At the
restaurant, her father raised a toast with his glass of juice.
Father: “To Rhea, for chasing her dreams and never giving up. We’re so proud
of you.”
Rhea blushed as other diners glanced their way.
Mother: “And here’s to all the wonderful experiences you’ll have at SOS.
Remember, it’s not just about studying but also about growing as a person.”
Rhea: “Thank you, both of you. I wouldn’t be here without your support.”




Scene 5: Packing and Preparations
The next few days were a blur of activity. Rhea and her parents began shopping
for everything she’d need for college—clothes, books, and a few decorations for
her dorm room.
Mother: “Do you think you’ll need extra bedding? What if it gets cold?”


17 | P a g e
18


Rhea (laughing): “Mom, it’s not like I’m moving to the mountains. It’ll be
fine!”
Father: “And don’t forget to take this family photo. You’ll need it when you’re
homesick.”
As they packed, Rhea’s excitement grew. She could hardly wait to start this new
chapter of her life.




Scene 6: Arriving at SOS
The drive to SOS University was filled with excitement and a hint of
nervousness. As the campus gates came into view, Rhea felt her heart skip a
beat. The sprawling lawns, towering buildings, and bustling students made it
feel like a whole new world.
Her parents helped her carry her bags to her dorm room. The walls were
adorned with motivational posters, and the room had a cozy yet vibrant energy.
Her roommate, a cheerful girl named Ananya, greeted her warmly.
Ananya: “Hi! You must be Rhea. I’m Ananya. Looks like we’re going to be
roommates!”
Rhea (smiling): “Nice to meet you, Ananya. I’m looking forward to this.”
Ananya (grinning): “Trust me, Rhea, SOS is going to be an adventure. Just wait
till you see the clubs fair tomorrow!”
Rhea chuckled, feeling her nerves ease a little. Maybe this was exactly where
she was meant to be.




Scene 7: Saying Goodbye
After unpacking and setting up her dorm room, Rhea stood with her parents, a
mix of excitement and nervousness in her heart. Her mother straightened the
corner of Rhea’s bedsheet for the third time, trying to keep herself busy as her
emotions threatened to overwhelm her.
Mother: “Promise you’ll call every day?”
Rhea (smiling): “Every day, Mom. I promise.”
18 | P a g e
19


Her father stepped forward, offering a firm handshake that quickly turned into a
warm hug.
Father: “Go out there and shine, Beta. Remember, this is just the beginning.”
Ananya, standing by her desk, chimed in cheerfully.
Ananya: “Don’t worry, Auntie, Uncle. I’ll take good care of her! She’s in safe
hands.”
Mother (smiling): “You better. And good luck to you too, dear. Make the most
of it!”
Father: “Yes, both of you—work hard, but don’t forget to enjoy yourselves.”
Rhea nodded, swallowing the lump in her throat. “I’ll miss you both. Thank you
for everything.”
Her parents lingered for a moment, exchanging one last look with her, before
stepping out of the room. The door closed softly behind them, leaving Rhea and
Ananya to take in the beginning of their new chapter together.




Scene 8: First Night in the Dorm
That night, as Rhea lay in her new bed, staring at the unfamiliar ceiling, a swirl
of emotions coursed through her. The room was small but cozy, with soft yellow
lighting that reflected off the pale walls. Her belongings, still half-unpacked,
were scattered across the desk and floor—her favorite books, a photo frame of
her parents, and the soft throw blanket her mother had tucked into her suitcase
at the last moment.
The faint hum of chatter and laughter seeped in from the hallway, a reminder
that she was no longer at home but in a place buzzing with new energy. She
missed her parents—the way her father teased her, her mother’s warm smile as
she poured her coffee—but there was also a sense of exhilaration bubbling
under the surface. This was her chance, her leap into a world she had dreamed
about for so long.
She reached for her journal, the familiar weight of it grounding her amidst the
unfamiliar surroundings. Flipping to a fresh page, she paused, her pen hovering


19 | P a g e
20


as she gathered her thoughts. The silence of the room felt comforting, a blank
canvas waiting to be filled. Finally, she began to write:
"Today marks the first day of my new life. SOS University, here I come. I’m
ready for whatever comes my way. For the challenges that will push me, for the
friendships I’ll make, and for the stories waiting to unfold. This is where I’ll
build my future, and maybe even discover parts of myself I didn’t know existed."
She stopped, a small smile tugging at her lips. Closing the journal, she placed it
on the nightstand and reached for the bracelet on her wrist, running her fingers
over the engraved words, "Keep Moving Forward.". A wave of comfort washed
over her.
As she turned off the light and nestled under the blanket, she allowed herself to
dream—not just of exams and essays but of coffee-filled late-night discussions,
bustling club meetings, and quiet afternoons spent writing on the campus lawns.
She didn’t know what lay ahead, but for the first time, the uncertainty didn’t
scare her.
It felt like the beginning of a story she was finally ready to write.

          Chapter 4: Stepping into a New World


Scene 1: First Day on Campus
The morning sun shone brightly through the towering trees that lined the
pathways of SOS University, casting long shadows over the wide expanse of
green lawns. Rhea’s footsteps echoed softly on the paved walkways as she made
her way across the campus, her heart racing with a mix of excitement and
nervousness. Her backpack, now a familiar weight, hung over her shoulder, the
only thing she had brought with her into this new world.
The campus was unlike anything she had ever seen. It was alive with energy—
students laughing and chatting in small groups, some hurrying to their classes,
while others strolled leisurely, seemingly comfortable in their new surroundings.
The buildings, made of sleek glass and modern steel, reflected the sunlight in
sharp angles, giving the whole campus an almost futuristic feel. The paths were
dotted with benches and shade trees, providing little pockets of quiet amidst the
bustling life around them.
Rhea couldn’t help but be in awe. She had spent so long preparing for this day,
but now that she was here, it felt surreal. The air itself seemed filled with a kind
of vibrancy she had never experienced before, the hum of ambition and
possibility all around her.
Rhea (thinking): This feels so different. It’s like the world is opening up in front
of me. I can feel it... a whole new chapter starting.
She slowed her pace, taking it all in. A group of students was gathered under a
large tree, their faces animated as they debated some topic with passion. Their
hands were flying through the air, making their points as they laughed and
argued, the intensity of their conversation drawing Rhea’s attention. It was as if
they had already found their place here—sure of themselves, sure of what they
wanted.
Further ahead, she spotted a lone guitarist sitting on a bench. His fingers moved
deftly over the strings, strumming a mellow tune that seemed to capture the
essence of the campus itself: relaxed yet purposeful. A small crowd had
gathered around him, some sitting cross-legged on the grass, others leaning
21 | P a g e
22


against the bench, lost in the music. Rhea couldn’t help but smile as she walked
past, the peaceful yet lively atmosphere feeling like something she had been
longing for.
Everything about SOS University seemed to reflect a blend of tradition and
modernity—a place where creativity, intellect, and passion came together. The
students here weren’t just focused on academics; they were also in tune with
their surroundings, involved in discussions, art, and music. It was a far cry from
the rigid, structured environment she had left behind.
Rhea (thinking): This is what I’ve been waiting for. A place where I can learn,
explore, and truly grow. Where I don’t have to fit into a mold.
She passed by the towering library, the glass walls giving a glimpse of students
hunched over their laptops or buried in books, deep in thought. She could
already picture herself among them, feeling the same pull of curiosity and the
hunger for knowledge. Each student here seemed to be working towards
something, focused but free.
Her gaze lifted, and she saw a large courtyard ahead, bustling with activity. In
one corner, a group of people were setting up for some kind of event, while in
another, a couple of students were sketching in their notebooks, completely
immersed in their art. The place was a beautiful chaos, a reflection of all the
endless possibilities that lay ahead.
Rhea couldn’t help but feel small in the grandness of it all, but she also felt like
she was exactly where she was supposed to be. This place, with all its life and
energy, was more than just a university to her. It was a chance—a chance to
redefine who she was, to explore her dreams, and to be part of something bigger
than herself.
She took a deep breath, feeling the weight of everything she had left behind and
the promise of everything that was yet to come.
Rhea (smiling softly to herself): I’m ready for this. Tomorrow onwards get ready
for everything that comes your way. This is just the beginning.




22 | P a g e
23


Scene 2: The Dorm Dynamics
Back in her dorm, her roommate Ananya was already dressed, scrolling through
her phone.
Ananya (excitedly): “Rhea, are you ready for the first day? Our class is in the
Red Wing. That building over there with the glass front.”
Rhea (nervous): “Yeah, I think so. It feels a bit overwhelming, though.”
Ananya (reassuring): “Don’t worry. Everyone’s feeling the same. You’ll find
your rhythm soon. Come let’s have a walk”
As they walked together to their building, Ananya pointed out the campus
hotspots—the cafeteria, the library, the sports complex.
Ananya: “And that over there? That’s the amphitheater. It’s where all the fun
stuff happens—open mics, fests, and debates.”
Rhea (smiling): “This place feels like a dream.”




Scene 3: Entering the Classroom
The next day, Rhea woke up with an unusual sense of excitement. She couldn’t
wait to step into the classroom, to begin this new chapter of her journey. The
thought of learning something new, meeting classmates, and getting into the
rhythm of university life filled her with anticipation. As she prepared for class,
she found herself eager to embrace every moment, to dive into the subjects that
had always intrigued her, and to make the most of this fresh start. The
nervousness she felt the previous day was replaced by a sense of purpose and
excitement. The classroom was spacious, with large windows letting in natural
light. Students filled the rows, some chatting, others absorbed in their phones or
notebooks.
Rhea chose a seat near the middle, not wanting to draw too much attention. A
tall boy with glasses turned to her.
Boy: “Hey, new here?”
Rhea (nodding): “Yeah. First day.”
Boy (smiling): “Same. I’m Arjun. Nice to meet you.”

23 | P a g e
24


Rhea: “Rhea. Nice to meet you too.”
Before they could continue, a professor walked in, commanding immediate
silence.
Professor: “Good morning, everyone. Welcome to your first semester at SOS
University. I’m Professor Sen, and I’ll be teaching you Microeconomics.”
Rhea quickly pulled out her notebook, feeling a mix of excitement and
nervousness.




Scene 4: The Lecture Experience
The lecture hall was spacious, with rows of neat desks arranged in a semi-circle
around the professor’s desk. Rhea sat near the back, her eyes scanning the room.
There were around thirty students in total, each one quietly settling in as the
lecture was about to begin. She could feel a nervous excitement building inside
her; this was her first economics class, the beginning of a journey she had been
eagerly anticipating for months.
Professor Sen, a middle-aged man with graying hair and a calm demeanor, stood
at the front of the class. He adjusted his glasses and smiled warmly at the
students, his presence exuding both authority and approachability.
Professor Sen: “ Before we dive into the course material, let’s start with a brief
introduction. Tell us your name, where you’re from, and why you chose to study
economics. Let’s go around the room.”
Rhea’s heart skipped a beat as the professor’s gaze swept across the room, and
she realized it was her turn soon. She took a deep breath, gathering her thoughts.
She wasn’t used to speaking in front of a class, but she had prepared herself for
this moment. She had been so focused on the idea of studying economics that
she hadn’t really thought about how she’d introduce herself to her classmates.
As the introductions began, Rhea listened intently, trying to calm her nerves.
The first student, a tall boy with glasses, stood up and spoke confidently. "Hi,
I’m Arjun, from Mumbai. I’ve always been interested in how the economy
works and how it shapes people's lives. I want to understand how policies affect
development."

24 | P a g e
25


Next was Priya, a quiet girl with short black hair, who smiled softly as she
spoke. "I’m Priya from Chennai. I’ve always been curious about global
economics, and I hope to use my knowledge to work in international relations."
Rhea glanced around the room. Each person had a different reason for being
there, a different path that had led them to this very moment. Some spoke with
great enthusiasm, others with a quiet passion, but all shared a common thread—
a genuine interest in economics.
When it was Rhea’s turn, she stood up, feeling the eyes of her peers on her. For
a moment, she hesitated, but then she straightened her shoulders, drawing
strength from the sense of belonging she had begun to feel.
Rhea: “I’m Rhea Agarwal, and I’m from Bangalore. I’ve always been intrigued
by the way markets work and how economic decisions affect societies. I’m here
to learn, to understand how economies function, and hopefully, to contribute to
positive change in the future.”
She sat back down, feeling a slight rush of relief. The room was silent for a
moment, but then Professor Sen smiled approvingly and nodded.
Professor Sen: “Thank you, Rhea. It’s great to hear such diverse interests. I hope
this course will give you the tools to explore those interests more deeply.”
As the introductions continued, Rhea felt a growing sense of connection with
the class. She wasn’t the only one with big dreams and questions about the
world. There were people here who shared her curiosity, her passion for
learning. It was a small but comforting realization.
After everyone had introduced themselves, the professor began the lecture,
diving into the course syllabus with clarity and purpose. His voice was engaging,
and Rhea found herself hanging on to every word. It was clear that he wanted
his students not only to understand the technicalities of economics but also to
appreciate its broader impact on society.
As the lecture progressed, Rhea took notes diligently, occasionally glancing at
her classmates. She noticed how focused they all seemed. There were no
distractions, no side conversations. It was a sharp contrast to her previous
experiences, where students often seemed disinterested or disengaged.
Rhea (thinking): This feels different. Everyone here is genuinely interested,
focused on learning. It’s like being in the right place at the right time.

25 | P a g e
26


As the professor explained the key concepts, Rhea felt a deep sense of
connection to the subject. She knew that she had made the right choice in
coming here. The road ahead was going to be challenging, but it was one she
was eager to travel.
By the time the class ended, Rhea was already looking forward to the next
session, excited to continue her journey in economics. She had entered a world
of possibilities—a place where her questions would be answered and her
curiosity would be nurtured.




Scene 5: The Cafeteria Crowd
After class, Rhea and Ananya headed to the cafeteria. It was buzzing with
activity—students in groups laughing, eating, and chatting.
Ananya: “The food here is actually pretty good. Let’s try the masala dosa.”
As they sat down with their plates, a girl from their class approached.
Girl: “Mind if I join you? I’m Priya.”
Ananya: “Of course! I’m Ananya, and this is Rhea.”
Priya: “So, how’s everyone finding the first day? I feel like I’m already
drowning in the syllabus.”
Rhea (laughing): “Same here. But it’s exciting too, right?”
The three of them chatted, sharing their backgrounds and first impressions of
the university. Rhea felt a sense of belonging starting to form.




Scene 6: Reflecting on the Day
That evening, after a long day of new experiences, Rhea found herself lying in
bed in her dorm room, staring at the ceiling. The room was quiet, save for the
faint rustle of leaves outside the window and the distant hum of campus life. It
was a peaceful kind of quiet, the kind that felt like a soft exhale after a day of
excitement and change.


26 | P a g e
27


Her mind replayed the events of the day—each one still vivid in her memory.
The feeling of walking across the SOS University campus, the vast lawns
stretching out before her, and the energy that filled the air. The students rushing
past her, each with their own purpose, their own path. It was a place that felt
alive, a place that welcomed her with open arms.
Rhea (thinking): It’s different here. People are passionate about what they’re
learning, and everyone seems to have a direction. It’s like they already know
what they want to do with their lives.
She remembered the lecture in Professor Sen’s class—the way he explained
economics, not just as a set of theories or formulas, but as a way to understand
the world. The way people’s choices shaped everything around them, from the
markets to the environment. It was challenging, but it felt exciting. For the first
time, Rhea felt like she was on the verge of something bigger. This wasn’t just
about passing exams or memorizing concepts; it was about making sense of the
world she lived in.
Then there were the people she met—Ananya, her new roommate, with her
bright energy and infectious smile; Priya, who seemed reserved but had a sharp
mind and a quiet passion for learning; and the others, each with their own story,
their own reason for being here. Rhea had been nervous about making
connections, but already, she could feel the beginnings of friendships forming.
Rhea smiled as she thought about the brief conversations she’d had with her
classmates. Everyone seemed so different from one another, yet they were all
brought together by a shared goal—understanding and learning. The diversity of
backgrounds, ideas, and ambitions made her feel like she was in the right place,
a place where her own aspirations could take root and grow.
Rhea (writing in her journal): Today was overwhelming but also amazing. SOS
University feels like a place where I can finally be myself, where I can grow and
explore. I can’t wait to see what tomorrow brings.
As she closed her journal, she felt a sense of peace wash over her. This was just
the beginning, she knew. There would be challenges ahead, moments of doubt
and confusion, but for the first time in a long time, Rhea felt ready to face
whatever came her way. The uncertainty didn’t scare her anymore—it excited
her.



27 | P a g e
28


She looked around her room, the small but cozy space that was now hers, and
felt a sense of belonging. The posters on the walls, the books scattered across
the desk, the string lights twinkling softly in the corner—it all felt like her own
little corner of the world. It wasn’t perfect, but it was hers, and that was enough
for now.
Rhea switched off the light and pulled the blanket up to her chin. The campus
outside was quiet now, but she could still hear the echoes of the day in her
mind—the laughter, the discussions, the sense of community. A smile tugged at
her lips as she closed her eyes, drifting off to sleep.
Tomorrow, she thought, tomorrow will be even better.




     Chapter 5: The Girl Who Didn’t Believe in Love

28 | P a g e
29




Scene 1: The Silent Observer
Rhea sat alone at the corner of the bustling campus café, her eyes scanning the
pages of her economics textbook. The clinking of coffee cups and the low hum
of conversation around her were the background to her thoughts, but they didn’t
distract her. She was used to tuning the world out. She always had been.
There was something oddly comforting about being unnoticed in a crowd.
Something about it made her feel safe. She wasn’t the loud, attention-seeking
type. In fact, she prided herself on her quiet demeanor. She observed she
listened, but she didn’t participate in the noise. She didn’t need to. Rhea found
solace in the solitude of her own thoughts, where she was always in control,
always at peace. At least, that’s what she liked to tell herself.
Her dark hair, usually pulled back in a messy bun, fell around her shoulders
today in soft waves. She wore a simple black hoodie, jeans, and a pair of
sneakers—comfortable, unremarkable. Everything about her screamed normal,
mundane, and that was just how she liked it. There were no expectations, no
pressure to be anything other than herself.
Rhea (internally, sighing): People like me don’t get noticed. And I’m perfectly
fine with that.
She took a sip of her coffee, letting the bitter warmth settle in her chest. Her
fingers traced the rim of the cup absentmindedly, her mind drifting to her
childhood—a childhood where love had never been a constant, never a source
of comfort. She had learned early on that emotions were messy, and unreliable.
They were like storms—beautiful from a distance, but dangerous up close. Love
was the most unpredictable storm of them all.




Scene 2: The Family She Admired

29 | P a g e
30


Rhea had always admired her parents, not for the grand gestures or the loud
displays of affection, but for something simpler—something she knew not
everyone had. Despite their busy careers and demanding lives, they always
made time for her. It wasn’t the kind of love she’d seen in movies or heard
about from friends, but it was theirs, and it was enough for Rhea.
Her mother, a dedicated editor, was often consumed by her work, her nose
buried in books and manuscripts. Yet, Rhea knew that whenever she needed her,
her mom would make sure to carve out time—whether it was a quiet dinner
together or just a moment in the kitchen where they’d talk about everything and
nothing. Rhea could see the warmth in her mother's eyes, even if it wasn’t
always vocalized. It was in the way she adjusted Rhea's collar before she left for
school or made her favorite dessert on a random afternoon.
Her father, a successful businessman, had a demanding schedule that often kept
him away, but when he was home, he always made an effort. Whether it was
taking her to dinner or asking about her day, Rhea appreciated the moments they
had together. His love wasn’t loud, but there was a steady consistency in the
way he provided for their family, a kind of love that wasn’t always wrapped in
words but in actions.
Her friends often spoke about their parents—how their fathers would surprise
their mothers with flowers, how their mothers would light up when their fathers
walked through the door. They would talk about the way their parents held
hands, exchanged sweet words, and laughed together over dinner. They seemed
to have this effortless love, or at least, that’s how it seemed. Rhea would listen
as they shared stories of the affection they received, and how their parents made
them feel safe and cherished. Some would even dream aloud about finding
someone who loved them as much as their parents loved each other. But Rhea
never had those memories. Instead, she had memories of quiet dinners, where
her parents sat across from each other but never really spoke. There were no
gestures of affection, no words of encouragement or concern. It was as if they
were coexisting more than truly living together.
Rhea (internally reflecting): They may not express love the way some people
expect it. No grand declarations, no endless talks about feelings. But they’ve
always been there. And maybe that’s what really matters—being present, even
when the world demands so much of you.



30 | P a g e
31


There was something comforting in the fact that, despite their professional lives,
her parents always made sure to give her their time. They weren’t perfect, but
Rhea admired how they had managed to keep their family together through the
years. They showed her, in their own quiet way, that love wasn’t just about
passionate moments; it was also about consistency and being there when it
mattered most.
But there was one thing Rhea could never truly admire about their
relationship—the way they shared a kind of politeness, an unspoken
understanding between them. It wasn’t cold, but it wasn’t fiery either. It wasn’t
the kind of love that made her heart race. It was steady, almost mechanical in its
calmness. They worked well together, as partners in both life and business, but
there was something missing—something Rhea couldn’t quite place.
She didn’t know if she’d ever understand what that kind of love was, and maybe
she didn’t need to.
Rhea (internally): Maybe that’s why I’ve never really believed in love. I’ve seen
it, sure, but it never felt like something that could be fully understood. A concept
they pretend to understand, but no one really does. At least not in my world. It’s
just... something that happens because it’s supposed to. Or maybe that’s just
what I’ve been told.
Rhea pushed the thought aside. Love, for her, wasn’t a necessary thing to seek.
She had her parents, their steady presence, and that was enough. She didn’t need
the kind of love that everyone else seemed to chase after. She was doing fine,
handling life on her own terms.




Scene 3: The Friends Who Didn’t Understand
At school and college, things weren’t much different. Rhea had friends—sure,
she did. She was sociable enough. But they never quite understood her. She
didn’t fit into the mold they wanted to create. Her friends were all about
relationships, crushes, and the endless drama that came with them. They talked
about their boyfriends and girlfriends like they were the end-all-be-all of
existence. They gushed about their first kisses, their “soulmates,” and the love
letters they received. To Rhea, it all seemed so... pointless.


31 | P a g e
32


Friend (chatting on the phone): “Ugh, he didn’t reply to my text for like two
hours. I’m freaking out! What do I do?”
Rhea (internally, rolling her eyes): That’s the thing about love. It’s nothing but a
game. A constant cycle of waiting, disappointment, and then pretending it’s all
worth it.
Her friends didn’t get it. They didn’t understand why Rhea wasn’t into all that
romantic nonsense. They assumed she was just being a “tough girl” or “playing
hard to get,” but the truth was far simpler: Rhea didn’t believe in the idea of
love that everyone else seemed so obsessed with. She didn’t need someone to
complete her, didn’t need a relationship to feel validated. She was content in her
world, where things were predictable, safe, and above all—rational.




Scene 4: The Walls She Built
It wasn’t just love that Rhea had learned to shut out; it was everything that came
with it. Vulnerability, attachment, need—these were all feelings she had worked
hard to avoid. She was the type of person who kept her distance, who kept her
emotions wrapped in layers of impenetrable walls. And it worked, for the most
part.
At times, though, those walls felt too high, too thick, and she couldn’t help but
wonder if maybe—just maybe—there was something she was missing. The
loneliness, the emptiness—it was a quiet ache that she buried deep inside
herself. She’d never admit it out loud, of course. Not to anyone.
Her life had always been about maintaining control. Love was messy. People
were messy. The best way to survive was to keep your heart hidden away, safe
and untouched.
Rhea (internally, to herself): I’m fine on my own. I don’t need anyone. I don’t
need love. And I’m certainly not going to fall for some guy just to prove
something to myself.
And yet, in the quiet corners of her mind, the thought lingered: But what if I’m
wrong?



32 | P a g e
33


Scene 5: A New Beginning?
It was on an ordinary day, much like any other, that her life was about to change.
Rhea had been going through her usual routine, headphones in, eyes glued to
her textbook as she walked across campus, lost in thought. She was in her own
world, completely unaware of anything around her—until she collided with him.
Kush.
It wasn’t dramatic. Just a simple bump, a misstep in the hustle of campus life.
But in that brief moment, time seemed to slow down. For a second, Rhea
couldn’t breathe—not from the collision, but from the sudden rush of emotions
that followed. Her heart skipped a beat, her thoughts scrambled, and her feet
faltered.
She quickly stepped back, flustered, looking up at him, ready to apologize.
Rhea: "I’m so sorry! I wasn’t looking where I was going."
Kush (with a soft, understanding smile): "It’s alright, no harm done."
They exchanged quick, awkward glances before they both turned and continued
on their separate ways, the brief interaction ending as quickly as it had begun.
But as Rhea walked away, she couldn't shake the feeling that something had
shifted in the air around her. Something about that moment felt significant, but
she couldn’t place why.
Rhea (internally, confused): Why am I acting like this? I don’t even know him.
Why do I feel like I’ve just stepped into a completely different world?
The question lingered in her mind as she moved through the rest of her day. No
matter how hard she tried to push it away, the feeling of that brief encounter
kept creeping into her thoughts.




33 | P a g e

               Chapter 6: The World She Knows


Scene 1: The Campus Café
Rhea’s feet lightly tapped against the pavement as she made her way toward the
familiar campus café, a small corner tucked between the towering buildings of
SOS University. It was a place where students congregated, finding brief solace
in coffee and pastries between lectures. The air was thick with the scent of
freshly brewed coffee, and the low murmur of conversation created an oddly
comforting hum that surrounded her. This was where Rhea felt at home.
She wasn’t one to show up early, but every now and then, she made her way
here before her first class to get a seat by the window. The small wooden tables,
the mismatched chairs—everything about the café had a lived-in feel, as though
the place had witnessed thousands of half-finished conversations, forgotten
homework assignments, and laughter-filled moments. But for Rhea, it was just a
place to be by herself before the bustle of the day began.
She stood in line at the counter, waiting for her usual—black coffee with a dash
of cinnamon. The barista, a friendly guy named Rohan, greeted her with a smile
that never seemed to fade. They had exchanged pleasantries a few times, but
Rhea never let the interaction go beyond a polite smile.
Rohan (handing over her coffee): “Busy day ahead?”
Rhea (with a small nod): “Yeah, seems like it. Economics never stops.”
Rohan chuckled as she took the cup from him and walked over to her usual spot,
by the window. She settled into her seat, the warm drink in her hands, her
textbook open but her attention elsewhere.
Outside, the campus buzzed with activity. Students hurried to their next lecture,
some walking in pairs, others engrossed in their phones, while a group of girls
sat on the grass patch, laughing and chatting. Rhea watched them, feeling a
strange sense of detachment. She wasn’t jealous of their carefree nature; it was
just... not her world.




34 | P a g e
35


Scene 2: The Girls’ Circle
After a few minutes of reading, Rhea’s peace was interrupted when her phone
buzzed on the table. It was a text from Ananya, one of her friends in the class.
Rhea smiled, typing back a quick response.
Ananya (text): “Canteen? We’re all here. I saved you a seat!”
Rhea wasn’t the type to hang out in large groups, but she had grown
comfortable with Ananya and her two other friends, Nina and Priya. They were
loud, exuberant, and talked incessantly about relationships, shopping, and life,
while Rhea often stayed on the outskirts, adding her two cents only when it felt
necessary.
Rhea (texting back): “Coming.”
As Rhea made her way to the table, she could already hear the chatter from the
girls. Ananya, the most talkative of the bunch, was in the middle of a story, her
hands animatedly describing an argument with her boyfriend. Meera listened
intently, chiming in with occasional “Oh my God”s and “That’s so dramatic”s.
Ananya (with a dramatic sigh): “And then he had the audacity to accuse me of
ignoring him! Like, excuse me? I was just busy with college work!”
Meera (laughing): “What did you say?”
Ananya (smiling triumphantly): “I told him, ‘If you can’t handle me at my
busiest, then you don’t deserve me in my free time.’ Classic, right?”
The girls burst into laughter, and Rhea couldn’t help but smile at Ananya’s
boldness. She envied her confidence, her ability to speak her mind so freely.
Sometimes, Rhea wished she could be like that—unapologetically loud,
unafraid to be vulnerable.
Rhea (sitting down, shaking her head): “You really are something, Ananya.”
Ananya (grinning): “I know, right? You need to try it sometime, Rhea. Stop
being the quiet observer all the time.”
Rhea shrugged, taking a sip of her coffee. She wasn’t sure she wanted to change.
Her role in this group—quiet, reserved, and always the listener—had always felt
comfortable. She wasn’t interested in stirring the pot like Ananya or getting
involved in the drama that seemed to follow her friends.


35 | P a g e
36


Ananya: (Taking a sip of her coffee) “So, Meera, you’ve been pretty quiet these
days. Everything okay with... well, with him?” (She smirks, raising an eyebrow
playfully)
Meera: (Chuckles lightly) “Oh, you know... it’s just... complicated. The usual
relationship stuff. Nothing new.”
Nina: (Leans in, teasing) “Complicated? You can’t leave us hanging like that,
Meera. What’s going on? Does he keep you guessing?”
Meera: (Shrugs) “Well... yeah, a bit. He’s... he’s not exactly an open book, you
know? But I guess I’m used to it now. He’s just got his own way of doing
things.”
Ananya: (Grinning) “Oooh, I know what this is. Mysterious guy vibe, huh?
Come on!”
Meera: (Pauses for a moment, then casually): Yeah Not the easiest guy to read,
but he’s got his charm.”
Nina: (Raises an eyebrow) “But seriously, I can tell there’s more to this. You
can’t just leave us hanging on this mysterious boyfriend of yours.”
Meera: (Laughs nervously) “Well, sometimes a little mystery is good, right? It
keeps things interesting.”
Ananya: (Chuckles) “Sure, but it sounds like he’s being a little... distant. Is he
hard to figure out, or are you just giving him too much space?”
Meera: “Maybe a bit of both. He’s just... different from anyone I’ve been with
before.”
Rhea: (Nods thoughtfully) “Well, different can be exciting. But just make sure
you’re not overthinking it.”
Meera: (Sighs) “I know... I just want to make sure things are real, you know?”
Priya: (Joining them at the table with a bright smile) “Hey, sorry I’m late, guys!
You wouldn’t believe what happened today!”
Rhea: (Grinning) “Let me guess... you ran into your boyfriend again?”
Priya: (Laughs and blushes) “Yes! And he’s just been so sweet lately. Honestly,
I didn’t expect it.”
Ananya: (Teasing) “Aww, what did he do now? Another surprise dinner?”

36 | P a g e

Priya: “Better! He got me this cute little charm for my bracelet. It’s a heart-
shaped locket, and he said it’s to remind me of him when we’re apart.”
Rhea: (Pretending to swoon) “Romantic! Honestly, Priya, you’ve got it all with
that guy.”
Meera: (Smiling faintly) “That’s sweet. I bet he’s a keeper.”
Priya: “Definitely. He’s just... been amazing recently. I don’t think I’ve ever felt
so connected to someone.”
Priya: (Looking at Meera with a knowing smile) “So, Meera, how’s it going
with your ‘boyfriend’? Are you two finally getting on the same page?”
Meera: (Forcing a smile, looking a little uncomfortable) “Yeah, we’re getting
there... slowly. It’s just... complicated.”
Nina: (Nods) “That’s fair. Relationships take time. But you know, once you’ve
found that rhythm, everything just falls into place.”
Meera: (Quietly) “I hope so.”
Rhea: “Exactly. It’s all about timing and letting things unfold naturally.”
Ananya: (Looking at Meera, with a playful grin) “Maybe we should do a little
matchmaking. I’m sure ‘Meera’s boyfriend’ will come around if you give him a
nudge.”
Meera: (Laughing nervously) “No need for that. He’ll figure it out when he’s
ready.”




Scene 3: The Relationship Talk
The conversation turned to relationships, as it often did when they all got
together. Priya, who was usually quiet, spoke up this time.
Priya (sighing): “I don’t get it. I mean, why is it so complicated to just be honest
with someone you like? Why do people always have to play games?”
Ananya (grinning mischievously): “Because it’s fun, duh. The chase is half the
thrill. If you don’t make them work for it, what’s the point?”


37 | P a g e
38


Rhea couldn’t help but roll her eyes. It wasn’t that she didn’t understand the
excitement of romance, but the whole concept of ‘playing games’ and
constantly testing the waters just seemed... exhausting to her. Relationships, in
her experience, never really lasted. They were full of uncertainty, expectation,
and the constant fear of being let down. Rhea didn’t need that kind of chaos in
her life.
Meera (nodding in agreement): “Exactly. If you just tell someone you like them,
what happens next? It’s over too quickly. No mystery, no drama. Where’s the
fun in that?”
Rhea remained silent, watching her friends. She found their enthusiasm for
romance both amusing and bewildering. For her, love wasn’t something to
chase, it was just a word people used to fill the empty spaces in their lives.




Scene 4: The Unspoken Divide
As the conversation continued, Rhea’s mind wandered. She listened, but her
thoughts drifted to the future—her upcoming assignments, the pressure of
exams, and the weight of her goals. Her friends, so wrapped up in relationships,
seemed to live in a world that was always searching for something. Rhea, on the
other hand, had always been fine with her own company. She had no desire for
the kind of love stories her friends seemed to crave.
But something lingered in the back of her mind, a quiet thought she hadn’t been
able to shake for some time now.
Rhea (internally, as she looked out the window): What if I’m wrong? What if
there’s more to this whole love thing than I’ve been willing to admit?
The thought was fleeting, and she quickly pushed it aside. She wasn’t someone
who needed to fall in love. She had a path laid out before her—a future of hard
work, ambition, and independence. Love was an unpredictable, uncontrollable
force, and she preferred to stay far away from it.




38 | P a g e
39


Scene 5: The Ride Back
After a couple of hours of chatting and finishing up their snacks, the group of
friends got up to leave. As they walked toward the parking lot, Ananya looped
her arm through Rhea’s.
Ananya (teasing): “You know, you’re the only one of us who hasn’t been on a
date in like, forever. What’s the deal? Not interested?”
Rhea chuckled, feeling a little uncomfortable under the direct question.
Rhea (shrugging): “I’m good. I don’t have time for that kind of stuff.”
Priya (smiling knowingly): “You’re too focused on your studies, that’s the
problem. You need to let loose a little. Go out with someone fun, stop being so
serious all the time.”
Rhea didn’t respond, instead just nodding and offering a half-smile. She wasn’t
interested in explaining herself. Her friends wouldn’t understand.
As she headed to her scooter, she caught a glimpse of a couple walking hand in
hand, laughing at something the boy had said. A pang of loneliness tugged at her
chest, but she ignored it. She had bigger things to focus on.
Rhea (internally, to herself): Love isn’t for me. I don’t need it to be happy.
But deep down, a small voice whispered—what if you were wrong?




39 | P a g e

                Chapter 7: A New Beginning

Rhea’s excitement bubbled over as soon as she heard about the various clubs at
her new university. Having already been a part of the Economics Club, she had
experienced the power of shared passion and the sense of belonging it gave her.
But when she learned about the Reading and Writing Club, her heart raced. It
was everything she had hoped for—an opportunity to nurture her love for
literature and hone her writing skills. She didn’t want to miss this chance,
especially after everything she had been through. Her desire to be a part of
something bigger, to meet like-minded individuals who shared her creative
spirit, grew stronger. This was her moment to truly immerse herself in the world
of writing and reading, and she couldn’t wait to seize it.




Scene 1: The Reading Club Introduction
Rhea had always been an avid reader, but she'd never really connected with
others over her love for books. That was until she found out about the
university's reading club. It was the perfect opportunity to not only indulge in
her love for literature but also to meet like-minded people.
She hesitated for a moment before walking into the club meeting. It wasn’t like
her to join such groups, but something told her this was different.
Reading Club Leader (Maya): "Welcome, everyone! For today’s session, we’ll
be doing a reading activity. Each of you will read a snippet of a book or a
passage that has left a lasting impact on you. Don’t be shy!"
Rhea’s heart skipped a beat. This was her chance to share her love for books.
She stepped forward, her voice steady despite the nervous flutter in her stomach.
She decided to read a snippet from one of her favorite books, The Catcher in the
Rye, a passage that had resonated with her deeply.
Rhea (reading aloud):
"I am always saying ‘Glad to’ve met you’ to people I don’t even know, and that’s
the trouble. I’m always thinking too much about the past and future and never
about the present. It’s no good to live that way, but I can’t stop it."
40 | P a g e
41


The room was silent for a moment, the weight of the passage lingering in the air.
Rhea looked up, feeling more vulnerable than she had expected. Nina, the club
leader, smiled warmly.
Maya (impressed): "Beautiful choice, Rhea. You really captured the essence of
the character."
Rhea felt a sense of accomplishment wash over her. It was a small step, but it
was enough to give her confidence.




Scene 2: The Writing Club Revelation
Later that week, Rhea attended the university’s writing club meeting. This was
where she could truly express herself, where her love for writing could finally
find a home.
The room was buzzing with excitement as students discussed various writing
styles and techniques. The head of the club, Sam, called for everyone’s attention.
Sam (smiling): "Alright, folks! Today we’re doing something a little different. I
want each of you to share a piece of your writing—be it poetry, prose, or short
stories. Don’t be shy; we’re all here to grow together."
Rhea took a deep breath. She wasn’t sure how her work would be received, but
she had to try. She stood up, feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness.
She shared a couple of her poems:
Poem 1:
"In the silence of night,
I hear my thoughts take flight,
Words unspoken, dreams untold,
A story waiting to unfold."


Poem 2:
"The world may turn, the seasons change,
But some things stay within the range,


41 | P a g e
42


Of hearts that beat in gentle rhyme,
Echoes of love, transcending time."




As she finished, there was a brief pause before Sam spoke.
Sam (smiling): "Wow, Rhea. Those were absolutely stunning. You have a
natural way with words. Keep writing, and don't be afraid to share your voice
with the world."
The other members nodded in agreement, their eyes reflecting the same
admiration. Rhea felt an overwhelming sense of pride. It wasn’t just about
sharing her work; it was about finally being heard.




Scene 3: A Sense of Belonging
After the meeting, Rhea lingered for a moment, talking to some of the club
members. It wasn’t just the compliments that made her feel good; it was the
sense of belonging, the realization that she had found a place where her passion
for writing and reading was not just accepted but celebrated.
As she walked back to her dorm later that evening, she couldn’t help but smile.
She was more than just a student here—she was a writer, a creator. And for the
first time in a long while, she felt like she truly belonged.




Scene 4: Sharing the News - A Call to Her Parents
Rhea sat back in her chair, her phone in hand, a soft smile on her face as she
dialed her parents' number. She had been bursting to share her excitement with
them. They had always been her biggest supporters, and now, after joining the
clubs, she had even more to tell them. Her heart swelled with pride as the phone
rang.
Her mother’s familiar voice echoed through the receiver.


42 | P a g e
43


Mother (cheerfully): "Hello, Beta! How are you?"
Rhea (grinning): "Hi, Mom! I’m doing great! I just wanted to share some
exciting news with you."
Mother (curious): "Oh, you’re keeping secrets now? What’s the news?"
Rhea (excitedly): "Well, I’ve joined the Reading and Writing Club at university!
It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a long time, and I finally took the plunge."
There was a pause on the other end, and then her mother’s voice filled with
warmth.
Mother (with pride): "Rhea, that’s wonderful! I knew you loved reading and
writing, but to hear that you’re actively pursuing it makes me so happy. How are
you finding it so far?"
Rhea (beaming): "It’s amazing, Mom! I’ve already shared some of my poems in
the Writing Club, and they loved them. I never thought I’d get such a positive
response. It feels so good to finally be part of something like this."
Mother (happily): "I’m so proud of you, sweetheart. I always knew you had it in
you. This is just the beginning, and I can already see how much you’re
blossoming."
Rhea's heart warmed at her mother's words. She could almost picture her
smiling on the other side of the phone, beaming with pride.
Rhea (laughing): "Thanks, Mom. I wish you could be here to see it all. I feel
like everything is finally falling into place."
Mother (lovingly): "You’ve worked so hard for this, Rhea. You deserve every
bit of it.”
Rhea (pausing, smiling softly): "Thanks Ma. I Love You Both."
Mother (with a chuckle): "We both Love You More Beta. We’re all here together,
supporting you from home, and we couldn’t be prouder."
Rhea (sincerely): "Thank you, Mom. It means everything to me to have you
both by my side, even from afar."
Just then, Rhea could hear her father's voice in the background.
Father (playfully): "What’s all this about joining clubs? Is this your way of
avoiding studying economics?"

43 | P a g e
44


Rhea (laughing): "No, Dad, I’m still all about economics! But this is something
I needed for myself, too."
Father (proudly): "Haha I was just pulling your leg. Just don’t forget that you
still have a degree to earn!"
Rhea (teasing): "I won’t forget, Dad. But I’m loving every moment of it. I’ll
keep you updated!"
Mother (lovingly): "We’ll be waiting to hear all about your next steps, Rhea.
Stay happy, stay focused. We love you."
Rhea (with a full heart): "I love you both so much. Thank you for always
believing in me."
As the call ended, Rhea leaned back in her chair, a sense of peace filling her.
Sharing the news with her parents had made the moment even more special.
Their encouragement meant the world to her, and with their unwavering support,
Rhea knew that no matter where her journey took her, she had a home and
family who would always be there to cheer her on.

               Chapter 8: A Chance Encounter


Scene 1: The College Event
It was a bright, bustling Tuesday afternoon when Rhea found herself amid a
college activity she hadn’t signed up for. The Economic Society was hosting an
event that would bring together students from various disciplines to collaborate
on solving community-related problems. Rhea, ever the diligent student, had
volunteered at the last minute to help with logistics—an arrangement she found
far more agreeable than participating in any group discussions.
The central hall of the university was abuzz with energy, as groups of students,
some in their best casual outfits and others in professional attire, mingled and
exchanged ideas. Rhea stood near the entrance, clipboard in hand, silently
observing the commotion. Her job was simple: keep track of the groups and
make sure everyone had their materials.
Her friend Ananya had tried to convince her to join one of the problem-solving
teams, but Rhea had politely declined. Being a part of the event felt enough like
“participation” to her. Plus, she wasn’t one for endless brainstorming sessions.
She enjoyed watching things unfold from a distance, finding the entire process
of team dynamics somewhat chaotic.
Ananya (calling from across the room): “Rhea, come on! At least sit with us for
a while! You’re wasting your time standing there!”
Rhea (shaking her head and smiling): “I’m good, Ananya. I’ve got this under
control.”
She turned her attention back to the students around her, ensuring that no one
was missing any necessary materials. That was when she heard a loud thud,
followed by a series of muffled apologies.




45 | P a g e
46


Scene 2: The Bump
Rhea’s gaze snapped to the source of the noise. A young man, taller than most
and dressed in a simple shirt and jeans, was bent over, helping pick up a few
fallen brochures from a nearby table. His eyes met hers, and for a brief moment,
Rhea found herself caught in the warm depths of his gaze. He smiled sheepishly,
his hand still reaching for a stack of papers.
Rhea (without thinking): “Are you okay?”
Kush (with a smile, standing up): “Yeah, just a little clumsy today.” He
chuckled nervously as he finished stacking the papers. “I’m Kush, by the way.”
Rhea blinked, recognizing him. His face seemed familiar, but she couldn’t place
where she had seen him before.
Rhea (nodding politely): “Rhea.”
She extended her hand, and Kush shook it with a firm but casual grip. He
seemed like the kind of guy who didn’t take himself too seriously—easygoing
and warm, with a hint of humor in his voice.
Kush (still smiling): “It’s nice to meet you, Rhea. Are you volunteering here?”
Rhea (gesturing to her clipboard): “Yeah, just helping out. I wasn’t really sure
about joining a team, so I’m keeping track of things instead.”
Kush (laughing): “Smart move. I wish I could do that. But I’m stuck on a team
with some really intense people. You know how it goes.”
Rhea (with a wry smile): “Yeah, I do.”
As they spoke, a few students passed by, and Rhea was momentarily distracted
by the noise. Kush took this moment to glance around the room as if looking for
something—or someone. But he seemed to return his attention to her just as
quickly.
Kush (gesturing to the papers in his hands): “I’m with the team discussing
sustainable farming practices. It’s not the most glamorous topic, but at least I
get to work with some interesting people.”
Rhea raised an eyebrow, intrigued by his casual demeanor. Most students
around her would have been far more eager to impress with their knowledge or
wit. Kush, on the other hand, seemed refreshingly down to earth.


46 | P a g e
47


Rhea (genuinely curious): “Sustainable farming? That sounds interesting,
actually. Not your typical college project.”
Kush (shrugging, grinning): “Yeah, it’s a bit out there. But you know what they
say—sometimes the most unconventional ideas lead to the best solutions.”
There was a pause, and for the first time, Rhea felt an odd connection—a spark
of something unexplainable. It wasn’t romantic, not yet, but it was there. Kush’s
openness, his straightforwardness, was disarming. He wasn’t trying too hard to
impress, and yet he did so effortlessly.




Scene 3: An Unlikely Conversation
The group next to them started gathering their things, preparing to move to
another station. The sudden rush of people caused Kush to take a step back,
inadvertently bumping into Rhea once again.
Rhea (laughing lightly): “Careful there.”
Kush (grinning, his eyes twinkling): “I swear, I don’t do this on purpose. You’re
safe, don’t worry.”
They both chuckled, and for a moment, the noise of the event faded around
them. It was as if time slowed, leaving just the two of them in the crowded room.
Kush (with a bit of hesitation): “So, you’re not into all the team chaos? What do
you do for fun, then?”
Rhea paused. She wasn’t used to sharing personal things with strangers,
especially not this easily. But there was something about Kush that felt…
approachable. Safe, even. She allowed herself to answer, though she kept it
simple.
Rhea (shrugging): “I’m mostly into books and writing. Not much of a party
person, to be honest.”
Kush (nodding, thoughtful): “I get that. Sometimes I feel like everyone’s so
caught up in pretending to be something they’re not. It’s nice to meet someone
who’s comfortable with just… being.”



47 | P a g e
48


There was something in his tone that made Rhea pause. The way he said it—
like he understood. Like he too had been in a space where fitting in didn’t
matter, and it was more important to just be true to who you were.
Rhea (softly, more to herself than to him): “Yeah, I guess so.”
Kush gave her a nod of understanding. He glanced around again, this time
catching sight of his team members waving him over from a nearby corner.
Kush (grinning): “I should probably get back to my team. They’re going to start
thinking I’ve abandoned them.”
Rhea smiled, appreciating his easygoing nature. She had expected him to be
another one of those people who was always in a rush, who never seemed to
slow down. But there was something refreshingly real about him.
Rhea (nodding): “Yeah, go ahead. It was nice talking to you, Kush.”
Kush (smiling back): “Likewise. Maybe we’ll bump into each other again.”
With a final grin, he turned to walk away, disappearing into the crowd. Rhea
stood still for a moment, watching him go. The brief encounter, the casual
exchange—it left her with a strange feeling, something between curiosity and
comfort.
She shook her head, returning to her clipboard. She wasn’t in the market for
relationships. Not now, and not with someone like Kush. Still, something about
their interaction lingered, a question she didn’t have an answer to yet.




Scene 4: A Quiet Reflection
The rest of the event moved on in its usual rhythm—conversations flowing in
and out, people laughing, exchanging business cards, and discussing future
projects. The atmosphere was filled with a kind of hurried energy, the buzz of
students and faculty members all trying to make the most of the evening. Rhea
found herself caught up in the ebb and flow, nodding politely to familiar faces,
offering brief greetings, and making sure to keep track of the numerous
conversations and connections being made. It was what she had come to expect
from such events—busy, noisy, and full of fleeting moments that would fade as
quickly as they had arrived.

48 | P a g e
49


But amid the chaos, one memory lingered in her mind, impossible to shake. The
brief exchange with Kush. His presence had been like a sudden quiet amidst all
the noise, and for reasons Rhea couldn’t fully explain, it had left an impression
on her. His calm demeanor, his thoughtful words, and that brief moment when
their eyes had met—it had felt almost... meaningful. For just a moment, it felt
like time had slowed down, and everything around her had blurred into the
background.
As the event began to wind down and the crowd started to thin, Rhea found
herself standing at the edge of the hall, her thoughts a tangled mess. She was
trying to focus on the tasks at hand—checking the final details, packing up
materials, and confirming future plans with a few people—but her mind kept
drifting back to him.
Rhea (internally): What was that all about? Just a random encounter. Nothing
more. It's probably nothing.
But the heaviness in her chest remained. It wasn’t quite a curiosity—though that
certainly played a part—but something else, something deeper. Was it a spark of
attraction? Or was it just the sense that there was something more to be
discovered, some kind of unspoken connection that she couldn’t quite grasp?
She didn’t know, and part of her didn’t want to know.
Trying to focus, Rhea quickly pushed the thought away. She wasn’t here for
distractions. She was here to build her future, to make the most of these
opportunities. Focus on your work, Rhea, she reminded herself firmly.
Yet, despite her best efforts, she found herself scanning the room once more,
almost instinctively. And when her eyes landed on the spot where she had last
seen him, the empty space seemed to echo in her chest. For a brief, fleeting
moment, Rhea couldn’t help but wonder if fate had some part to play in all of
this.
As she gathered her things, ready to leave, she caught herself thinking—just
once—that she wouldn’t mind running into him again. Maybe it was nothing.
Maybe it was everything. But for the first time in a while, Rhea wasn’t sure.




49 | P a g e

               Chapter 9: The Boy Named Kush


Scene 1: The Calm Before the Storm
The sun had barely begun to dip below the horizon as Kush stood near the
window of his small, cluttered room. His phone buzzed intermittently on the
desk, but he ignored it, preferring the quiet of the evening over the persistent
hum of notifications. He was used to the noise—life in college had a way of
making you numb to everything. But tonight, the stillness was different. It felt
like a moment of clarity in a world that was always rushing forward.
Kush’s room, though small, was lived-in. Books, notebooks, and random scraps
of paper littered the desk and floor. On the walls, posters of classic rock bands
and old movies gave it a homey, lived-in feel. Despite the disarray, it was clear
that Kush wasn’t one for keeping things neat. He preferred the chaos around
him. It felt more real that way.
He sat on the edge of his bed, flipping through a notebook. His thoughts drifted
back to the college event earlier that day. The moment he bumped into Rhea
lingered in his mind, though not for any particularly romantic reason. It was
just… simple. It felt real. In a place where everyone seemed to be trying too
hard, trying to be someone they weren’t, Rhea had stood out. She wasn’t
pretending, she wasn’t forcing anything—just herself.
A slight smile tugged at the corner of his lips. He had only exchanged a few
words with her, but those few moments had been enough to make him pause. He
wasn’t one to get easily distracted by people, but Rhea... there was something
different about her.




Scene 2: Kush’s Background
But that was enough about her. Kush had his own life, his own things to deal
with.



50 | P a g e
51


Born and raised in a middle-class family, Kush had always been the kind of kid
who kept to himself. He was intelligent and hardworking, but not the type to
seek attention. His parents, both busy professionals, had high expectations of
him—expectations that often weighed heavily on his shoulders. From a young
age, he was pushed toward success, and encouraged to pursue studies in fields
that promised stability and prestige. Engineering, medicine, or law were the
usual paths. But Kush had different plans.
He’d never really fit into the mold. Instead of following a rigid path set by his
parents, he’d rebelled in subtle ways, choosing his own journey in the field of
business management and sustainability. He wanted to make a difference in the
world, not just secure a comfortable life for himself. His interest in sustainable
farming, though unconventional for someone with his background, was more
than just a project—it was a passion. And it was that passion that had led him to
his current college.
Kush (to himself): “Maybe it’s not the most glamorous thing, but it’s mine. It
feels real.”
His parents, though supportive, didn’t fully understand. They had a vision for
his future, and it didn’t quite match up with his. They wanted him to take over
the family business one day, but Kush wasn’t sure that was the life he wanted to
lead. He loved his family, of course, but he didn’t want to live out their dreams.
He wanted to live his own.
There was another part of his life that his parents didn’t fully grasp—the
relationship he was in. Kush and His Girlfriend had been together for years now,
but he couldn’t shake the feeling that things were wrong. She was beautiful,
intelligent, and everything his parents had hoped for him in a partner. But there
was a coldness to her that he couldn’t ignore. She wasn’t bad—she wasn’t cruel
or malicious—but she had a way of making everything feel transactional.
Nothing about their relationship felt warm or genuine.
Kush had tried to make it work. He truly had. He loved her in the way that made
sense to him, in the way he’d been taught to love. But every day spent with her
was a reminder that love wasn’t just about compatibility or expectations—it was
about connection. And with her, the connection had long since faded.




51 | P a g e
52


Scene 3: A Conversation with his girlfriend
Kush’s phone buzzed again, vibrating insistently on the wooden desk. The glow
of the screen lit up the dimly lit room, pulling his attention from the half-
finished project on his laptop. He glanced over, expecting yet another
notification about work or an update on a group chat. Instead, the name flashing
on the screen made his stomach churn.
Love (text): “Are you done with your project for the day? We need to talk.”
The message felt heavier than it should, a weight that settled in Kush’s chest. He
picked up the phone but didn’t reply, letting the screen dim back into darkness.
A sigh escaped his lips as he leaned back in his chair, staring at the ceiling as if
it might offer answers.
For weeks now, they’d been having this conversation. Or rather, avoiding it.
Circling around the real issues like predators stalking prey, neither brave enough
to make the first strike. The tension between them was palpable, like a taut
string on the verge of snapping.
He stood abruptly, the chair screeching against the floor, and headed to the
kitchen. Maybe a snack would give him some clarity—or at least delay the
inevitable. As he opened the refrigerator door, the cold air hit his face, and his
thoughts wandered. Unbidden, Rhea’s face came to mind. Her laugh, her no-
nonsense attitude, the way she seemed to see right through him.
She wasn’t a part of his life, not really. Just a chance encounter, a fleeting
connection. But somehow, she’d managed to occupy a corner of his mind, a
quiet but persistent presence he couldn’t shake. She was unlike anyone he knew,
including the woman he was supposed to love.
His phone buzzed again, pulling him back to reality. Another message from his
Dearest.
Love (text): “Don’t avoid this, Kush. You know we need to sort things out. Call
me when you’re free.”
Kush closed the refrigerator door without grabbing anything, the snack
forgotten. He leaned against the counter, the cool surface grounding him as his
thoughts spiraled. What was there to sort out? Everything felt so frayed, so
distant. They’d been together for years, but lately, it felt like they were just



52 | P a g e
53


going through the motions. Conversations felt forced, laughter felt hollow, and
every touch felt like a question rather than an answer.
His phone buzzed again. This time, he picked it up and called her, bracing
himself for the conversation he knew was coming.
She answered on the second ring.
Love: “Kush.”
Her voice was soft but firm, like the calm before a storm. He could hear the
tension behind the single word, the weight of everything left unsaid.
Kush: “Hey. I got your messages.”
There was a pause on the other end, the silence stretching uncomfortably. He
heard her exhale, a sound that was equal parts frustration and exhaustion.
Love: “I don’t know how much longer we can keep doing this.”
Kush’s grip on the phone tightened. “Doing what?”
Love: “This. Pretending everything’s fine. Ignoring the cracks. You’ve been so
distant lately, Kush. It’s like you’re not even here anymore.”
He closed his eyes, leaning his head against the cabinet. She wasn’t wrong. But
what was he supposed to say? That he didn’t know how to fix things? That he
wasn’t sure if he even wanted to anymore?
Kush: “I’ve just been busy. You know how things are with college, classes,
clubs and everything.”
Love: “Don’t do that. Don’t brush me off like this is just about those. You’ve
been shutting me out, and I don’t know why.”
He opened his mouth to respond but hesitated. Was she right? Or was he just
afraid to admit the truth?
Love: (After a pause) “Is there someone else?”
The question hit him like a punch to the gut. His mind immediately went to
Rhea, even though nothing had happened between them. Could she sense that
he was distracted? That his thoughts weren’t entirely with her anymore?
Kush: “No. Of course not.”



53 | P a g e
54


His voice was steady, but the lie felt like acid on his tongue. Rhea wasn’t
someone else. She wasn’t anything—just a thought, a curiosity. But somehow,
that felt even worse.
Love: “Then what is it? Because I can feel it, Kush. You’re here, but you’re not
really here. And I can’t keep fighting for something if you’ve already given up.”
Her voice cracked at the end, the raw emotion cutting through him like a blade.
He wanted to say something, anything, to make it better. But the words
wouldn’t come.
Kush: “I’m not giving up.”
Love: “Then prove it. Because right now, it feels like I’m the only one trying.”
The line went silent again, the weight of her words hanging in the air. Finally,
she spoke, her voice quieter now.
Love: “I need you to think about what you really want, Kush. Not for me, but
for yourself. Because if this isn’t what you want... I need to know.”
Before he could respond, she ended the call. Kush stood there, the phone still
pressed to his ear, the empty tone in the receiver echoing in his mind.
His thoughts turned back to Rhea again, unbidden. She wasn’t a part of his life.
But maybe that was the problem. Maybe she was becoming something he
couldn’t ignore.
And that terrified him.




Scene 4: The Strain of Love
Kush returned to his desk, his phone still buzzing. He opened Love’s text again,
his fingers hovering over the keyboard. He had nothing to say, no way to
explain how he felt. What was the point of a relationship that felt like an
obligation?
Kush (typing out a message): “I’ll be there in 10 minutes. Let’s talk.”
As soon as the message was sent, he dropped the phone on the desk and sat
back in his chair. He rubbed his temples, trying to clear his mind. The past few


54 | P a g e
55


months had been a blur of half-hearted attempts at fixing something that maybe,
just maybe, wasn’t meant to be fixed.
And then there was Rhea.




Scene 5: The relationship felt unfinished.
Kush had always been an observer. He watched people, he read them, he
understood them better than they understood themselves. But Rhea was
different. She wasn’t an open book, not like his girlfriend though or anyone else
he’d known. She seemed closed off, yet there was something about her—
something deep and intriguing. Maybe it was her reluctance to talk about herself,
or maybe it was how she seemed completely unbothered by the world around
her.
Kush couldn’t pinpoint exactly what it was about her that drew him in, but he
knew he hadn’t felt this way in a long time. It wasn’t love—not yet, at least—
but it was curiosity. And curiosity had a way of growing into something else,
something that couldn’t be easily ignored.
As he walked out the door to meet his love, his thoughts lingered on Rhea.
Kush (to himself, softly): “I don’t know why, but I want to see her again.”

               Chapter 10: The Confusion Within


Scene 1: A Quiet Moment of Reflection
Rhea sat at her desk, gazing out of the window. The sun was setting over the
campus, casting a soft, golden hue over the buildings and trees. It was a
beautiful sight, one she had seen countless times, but today it felt different. She
didn’t know why, but it was as if the world had shifted, leaving her feeling off-
balance.
Her fingers drummed absent-mindedly on the edge of her notebook, but her
thoughts were far from her assignments. Kush—his name echoed in her mind
like a melody she couldn’t shake. She had tried to push the thoughts away, to
focus on her college work, her friends, and the things she was supposed to care
about. But there was no escaping the tug of something—something that felt
both unfamiliar and oddly comforting.
Rhea (thinking): Why am I even thinking about him?
She closed her eyes for a moment, trying to clear her mind. But the image of
him lingered. His calm, measured demeanor. The way his eyes met hers for that
split second when they bumped into each other. That brief, fleeting moment
when everything else faded away, and she felt something shift inside her.
Her heart raced, and she suddenly felt foolish. She had never believed in love at
first sight or any of that romantic nonsense. It was a waste of time, an illusion.
She was a practical person—focused on her studies, her goals, her future. She
didn’t have room for distractions. And yet, here she was, thinking about
someone she didn’t even know.
She grabbed her phone, half-heartedly scrolling through her notifications, trying
to distract herself. But it didn’t help. She couldn’t stop thinking about him.
Rhea (thinking): This doesn’t make sense. I don’t even know him. Why am I
feeling like this?
Her mind raced, trying to analyze the situation logically. She had met him for
mere seconds. They’d barely exchanged words. It was nothing. So why was it
affecting her so deeply? The logical side of her brain insisted that it was just a

56 | P a g e
57


random encounter, that it meant nothing. But her heart—her heart was saying
something different.
Rhea (thinking): Get a grip, Rhea. It’s just a passing thing. It doesn’t mean
anything.
She stood up abruptly, walking over to her window to breathe in the cool
evening air. The campus was quiet, the sounds of distant laughter and chatter
barely reaching her ears. She needed to get out of her own head.




Scene 2: The Inner Conflict
The next day, Rhea found herself walking through campus, her steps automatic,
her mind elsewhere. It was as if her body was moving on autopilot, while her
thoughts were still locked in that moment—bumping into Kush, the way his
voice sounded, the way his gaze lingered.
Nina, one of her close friends, waved to her from a distance. Rhea forced a
smile and walked over, trying to push away the feelings that were threatening to
overwhelm her.
Nina (playfully): "You’re looking lost today. What’s up?"
Rhea smiled again, though it felt stiff. She had gotten used to pretending, to
putting on a mask when things were going on inside her that she couldn’t quite
explain.
Rhea: "Just tired. Too much work to do."
Nina tilted her head, clearly not buying it.
Nina: "You sure? You’ve been acting a little off since yesterday. Did something
happen?"
Rhea’s mind flashed back to her encounter with Kush. She quickly shoved the
thought aside.
Rhea (forcing a laugh): "Nothing happened. Just the usual stress."
Nina raised an eyebrow but let it go, not pressing further. Instead, she shifted
the conversation, her voice lighter now.


57 | P a g e
58


Nina: "Have you seen the new guy, Kush? He’s been around a lot lately. I heard
he’s doing something cool with sustainability or something."
Rhea froze. Her stomach tightened, and she quickly turned away to mask her
reaction. She wasn’t sure why, but hearing his name made her feel… strange. A
little flutter in her chest, a twinge of something she didn’t want to acknowledge.
Rhea (casually): "Yeah, I met him briefly yesterday. He seems nice."
Nina’s face lit up, clearly interested.
Nina: "He is cute, right? Just my type. You should talk to him more."
Rhea felt a flush creeping up her neck, and she quickly changed the subject,
desperate to shift her focus.
Rhea (lightly): "He’s not my type."
But even as she said the words, she knew they weren’t true. There was
something about Kush. Something she couldn’t explain.




Scene 2: The Flashback – How Rhea and Nina First Met
Rhea had always considered herself someone who thrived in close-knit circles,
but she didn’t often step outside of those circles, especially when it came to
meeting new people. Her friends were her comfort zone—her classmates, those
who had known her for years, and the familiar faces that filled every corner of
campus. But Nina was different. She was the type of person who could easily
blend into a crowd yet still stand out in a way that made people notice her.
It was during the second semester of Rhea’s first year that she first met Nina,
and it happened unexpectedly, in a situation that would seem trivial to anyone
else but turned out to be a turning point in Rhea’s college life.
It started with a group project.
Rhea’s economics class had been split into teams for a research assignment on
the impact of global trade on local markets. Of course, as the ever-dedicated
student, Rhea was quick to take charge, organizing the team and assigning tasks.
She was confident in her ability to handle academic work, but there was
something about this group that made her uneasy. Unlike her usual teammates,

58 | P a g e
59


whom she knew well and had worked with before, this group was a mix of
unfamiliar faces—each with different personalities and varying levels of
enthusiasm for the project.
Among the group was Nina. Rhea remembered her as someone who had always
been quiet in class, often choosing to sit at the back, her face hidden behind her
thick-rimmed glasses and a book in her hands. Nina wasn’t the typical student
that Rhea would approach to collaborate with, but as the project leader, it was
her responsibility to include everyone in the group.
At first, their interactions were minimal. Rhea would email the team, assigning
work and trying to get feedback, but Nina’s replies were brief and often delayed.
She had the habit of drifting off in class, her attention seeming to be elsewhere,
though she always managed to contribute intelligent insights when the
discussions picked up. It was clear that Nina had a sharp mind, but she was
always in her own world, detached from the social dynamics of the class.
It wasn’t until their first in-person meeting for the project that Rhea had a
chance to talk to Nina outside of the academic context.
The meeting was set in the library, a quiet corner where they could focus on
their work without distractions. As Rhea arrived, she saw Nina already seated at
one of the tables, her laptop open, a cup of coffee beside her, and a notebook
full of scribbled notes. Nina didn’t look up when Rhea approached, her focus
entirely on the screen in front of her.
“Hey, Nina,” Rhea said, a little unsure of how to break the ice. “I just wanted to
make sure we’re on the same page with the project.”
Nina looked up, her expression neutral but not unfriendly. “Oh, hi. Yeah, I’ve
gone through the data. We need to focus on the comparative analysis between
local markets and international trade policies. I was thinking we could
incorporate more on the environmental impact too.”
Rhea was taken aback by how quickly Nina had grasped the topic and
formulated an idea. She hadn’t expected such a focused response. “You’ve
really thought this through, huh?” Rhea commented, settling down across from
her.
“I guess,” Nina shrugged. “I have my own way of looking at things.”



59 | P a g e
60


Rhea smiled, appreciating the honesty in Nina’s response. It wasn’t the usual
enthusiasm that her other classmates displayed, but there was something
refreshingly different about it. It was clear that Nina didn’t need validation from
others; she was content in her own thoughts, doing things on her own terms.
“Sorry, I wasn’t expecting you to be this...organized,” Rhea said, trying to
lighten the mood.
Nina gave a small, amused smile. “People usually think I’m not interested. But I
like getting things done in my own way.”
They fell into a comfortable silence as they worked together, bouncing ideas off
each other, the only sounds being the clicking of their keyboards and the
occasional rustle of papers. What Rhea found most surprising was how
effortlessly Nina integrated into the group. Her responses were always measured,
but they had substance. Slowly, Rhea realized that Nina wasn’t like the rest of
her classmates, who needed to be constantly reassured. Nina’s confidence came
from her quiet ability to know exactly what she was talking about, even when
she said little.
By the end of the session, Rhea was surprised at how much she had enjoyed
their conversation. They had managed to work through most of the project
details without a single heated argument or a single interruption. Rhea felt a
strange sense of respect for Nina—something she didn’t feel often. Maybe it
was because Nina didn’t need to prove anything, and that made her trustworthy
in a way that Rhea couldn’t quite explain.
As they packed up to leave, Rhea hesitated for a moment before speaking again.
“You know, I’m glad we’re working together. You’ve got a different way of
looking at things, and I think that makes the project better.”
Nina gave her a small, almost shy smile. “Thanks. I’m glad you’re leading this
group. It’s easier when someone else takes charge.”
Rhea chuckled. “It’s not always easy, but I appreciate you saying that.”
From that point on, Rhea and Nina developed an unspoken understanding. They
didn’t become fast friends right away, but they began to see each other
differently. Rhea found herself appreciating Nina’s quiet strength and ability to
think deeply about everything she did, while Nina began to realize that Rhea
wasn’t as conventional as she had first assumed. There was more to Rhea than
her perfectionist attitude and outgoing personality; there was a real person

60 | P a g e
61


behind it all, someone who had just as many doubts and uncertainties as anyone
else.
By the end of the semester, Rhea and Nina had become something like friends.
They still didn’t spend much time together outside of class, but whenever they
did interact, it was with a sense of mutual respect. Nina became one of those
people Rhea could rely on, not for validation, but for her straightforwardness,
her intelligence, and her calming presence. They didn’t talk much about their
personal lives, but they didn’t need to. Their bond was built on the shared
understanding of the world they lived in—a world that was often loud and
demanding, but also filled with quiet moments of clarity and insight.
It wasn’t until a few months later, after several more group projects and
assignments together, that Rhea realized just how important Nina had become in
her life. The quiet moments they shared during late-night study sessions, the
occasional chats over coffee, and the unspoken bond between them made Rhea
appreciate their unlikely friendship even more.
And so, Nina became a part of Rhea’s circle—one that she hadn’t planned on,
but one that she came to value deeply. Their friendship wasn’t about grand
gestures or endless conversations. It was about the understanding that, even in
the most unexpected places, connections could form and grow, becoming
something meaningful in ways they couldn’t have anticipated.




Scene 3: The Growing Longing
Later that evening, as Rhea sat in the common room, the feeling only grew
stronger. The lingering thoughts of Kush filled her mind like a constant hum.
She could still feel the warmth of his gaze, the way his presence seemed to fill
the space without saying a word.
She tried to focus on her work, but her mind kept drifting back to him. What
was it about him? Why did it feel like they had some kind of unspoken
connection? Was she just imagining things?
Rhea (thinking): I don’t even know him. How could I feel like this?




61 | P a g e
62


She glanced at her phone, half-hoping for a message from anyone—her friends,
her family. But there was nothing. Just the usual notifications, the same
meaningless messages.
Rhea (thinking): Am I waiting for something? What am I hoping for?
The more she tried to ignore it, the more the feeling grew, until it became almost
unbearable. She closed her eyes, leaning back in her chair, and for a moment,
the world outside her room disappeared. She could still feel his presence, like an
invisible thread pulling her toward him.




Scene 4: Unanswered Questions
The next day, Rhea went about her routine, but nothing felt the same.
Everything reminded her of him. The way he had smiled when she bumped into
him. The way he had looked at her for that brief moment, as if there was more
to the encounter than just an accident.
She couldn’t stop thinking about him. Even when she was with her friends, she
couldn’t shake the feeling that something was missing.
She saw Kush across the quad, talking to a group of students. He was laughing,
animated, completely at ease. And for a moment, Rhea stood there, watching
him. Her heart thudded in her chest, and she quickly turned away, as if being
near him was too much.
But as she walked away, she couldn’t help but glance back, just for a second.
Rhea (thinking): Why am I doing this? What is this feeling?
Her phone buzzed in her pocket, but she didn’t check it. She didn’t care about
anything right now—except the strange, undeniable connection she felt with
him. And that was the scariest part. She didn’t understand it, and she didn’t
know what to do with it.

           Chapter 11: A Step Towards Solitude?


Scene 1: Rhea’s Decision to Move Out – Mid-Second Year
It was one of those quiet afternoons in her second year, the kind when
everything seemed to slow down just long enough for her to catch her breath.
Rhea sat in the cramped dorm room she had called home since her first year at
SOS University. The room was a mix of textbooks, clothes, and half-empty
coffee cups, a reflection of her constantly busy life. She had gotten used to the
noise, the constant hum of her roommates' chatter, and the disorganization of
communal living, but something had been nagging at her for weeks.
She stood by the window, watching as the world outside moved at its usual
pace—students rushing to their next classes, groups of friends laughing in the
sun, a typical day at the university. But there was a sense of disconnect she
couldn’t shake. She wasn’t unhappy, but she wasn’t truly at peace either.
Rhea (thinking): This dorm room feels like it’s not mine anymore. It’s always
been a place to crash, not to live.
She ran her hand through her hair, staring at her reflection in the window. The
pressure of constantly being around people, of having to share every space,
every moment, had started to weigh on her. She needed something different,
something that felt more like her own.
Maybe it’s time to get my own place. A place where I can breathe, where I don’t
have to think twice about taking a call or leaving my things around. A space
that feels like it could be mine, truly mine.
It wasn’t an easy decision. The thought of leaving the familiar comfort of her
dorm was daunting. The friendships she had formed, the easy access to the
campus, the safety net of having people around—she would lose all of that. But
at the same time, she felt the need for independence, for space, for a fresh start
in a new chapter of her life.
The next day, Rhea sat down with her parents over a video call, her decision in
her mind fully formed.
Rhea: "I’ve been thinking a lot lately, and I want to move out of the dorms. I
think it’s time I get my own place."
63 | P a g e
64


Her mom’s eyes widened in surprise, but her dad looked thoughtful as if he had
anticipated this moment.
Dad: "Are you sure, beta? It’s not going to be easy. You’ll have to handle
everything—rent, bills, upkeep."
Rhea nodded.
Rhea: "I know, Dad. But I feel like I need to do this. It’s about growing up, and
it will help me focus better, be more independent."
Mom: "We understand, sweetie. But don’t forget, you’ll always have us to lean
on."
Rhea smiled, feeling a surge of gratitude.
Rhea: "Thanks, Mom. I’m really looking forward to it. I’ll figure everything
out."




Scene 2: The Conversation with Her Roommates - The Decision to
Move Out
Rhea had made up her mind. The idea of moving out had been on her mind for a
while, but it had become clearer over the past few weeks. She needed her own
space. The constant noise of the dorm room, the shared bathroom, the
interruptions—it had all started to wear her down. But now that the decision
was made, there was still the matter of telling her roommates.
It was a Thursday afternoon, and the sun filtered through the window, casting a
warm glow over the room. Her roommates, Ananya and Priya, were lounging on
their beds, browsing through their phones. The usual hum of dorm life was
present—laughter, random chatter, the sounds of TV shows from the common
area. Rhea had always felt a certain comfort in the chaos, but now it felt like it
was closing in on her.
She sat down on her bed, hesitating for a moment before speaking up.
Rhea: "Hey, guys, I’ve got something to tell you."
Ananya glanced up from her phone, her expression curious. Priya, who was
sitting cross-legged on the floor, didn’t even look up but raised an eyebrow.

64 | P a g e
65


Ananya: "What’s up? You look like you’re about to make some huge
announcement."
Rhea smiled softly, trying to muster the courage to say the words.
Rhea: "Well, I’ve decided to move out of the dorms. I’m getting my own place."
Priya dropped her phone to the floor, her eyes wide in surprise. Ananya’s
reaction was slower as if she was processing the words.
Ananya: "Wait, what? You’re leaving us?"
Rhea: "Not really leaving – leaving but yeah, I think it’s time. I’ve been
thinking about it for a while. It’s just... I need my own space, you know?"
Priya (still shocked): "But why? You’ve been here with us since the beginning.
Why leave now?"
Rhea paused, gathering her thoughts.
Rhea: "It’s not about you guys. It’s just... I’ve been feeling like I need to be on
my own. To figure things out. I’m just... not in a place where I’m comfortable
anymore. It’s not about you two, I swear."
Ananya: "I get it. I do. But it’s going to be so weird without you around."
Priya finally stood up and walked over to Rhea, her initial shock giving way to a
more thoughtful expression.
Priya: "I understand. You need to grow, to experience things on your own. But it
still feels like something is missing now. This place won’t be the same without
you."
Rhea felt a pang of guilt. She hadn’t expected this kind of reaction. She knew
they would miss her, but she hadn’t fully realized how much they had grown
accustomed to having her around.
Rhea: "I’m going to miss you both too, more than you know. But I need to do
this. I think it’ll help me become who I need to be, you know?"
Ananya: "Of course, we get that. But... you better not forget about us."
Priya: "Yeah, you can’t just disappear on us. We’re still your friends, okay?"
Rhea smiled, feeling a warmth in her chest. Her roommates’ support meant
more to her than she could express.

65 | P a g e
66


Rhea: "I won’t forget about you. I’ll visit. We can still hang out, I promise."
Ananya (teasing): "Just make sure we don’t have to move into your new place
when it gets lonely."
Priya: "Yeah, we might crash at your place one weekend, just to make sure
you’re not getting too used to being alone!"
Rhea chuckled, the tension easing between them.
Rhea: "I’d love that, honestly. I’m going to need all the distractions I can get.
It’s going to be an adjustment."
There was a brief silence, and then Ananya spoke again, her voice soft.
Ananya: "I think this is a good thing for you, Rhea. You’re going to do amazing
things on your own."
Priya nodded in agreement.
Priya: "We’re happy for you, even if we’ll miss you. Just make sure we’re still a
part of your life."
Rhea felt a rush of emotion. Her decision had been hard, but hearing their words
made her feel validated.
Rhea: "Thanks, guys. Seriously. I promise we’ll stay close."
With that, the conversation shifted to the practical details—helping her find a
place, brainstorming moving strategies, and plans for visits. But beneath the
surface, Rhea knew that something had shifted between them. This chapter of
their lives was coming to an end, and as much as she was looking forward to her
new apartment, part of her would always cherish the bond they had built in this
shared space.
As she got ready to leave for the day, Rhea took one last look around the dorm
room. It had been her home for almost two years now. And though it had always
been a bit chaotic, a bit noisy, it had also been a place where she had learned,
laughed, and grown. But now, it was time to step forward—into a new space, a
new chapter of her life.
This is mine. This is where I can finally start figuring things out on my own.




66 | P a g e
67


Scene: 3 Her Space
Rhea found a cozy, modest apartment tucked away on a quiet street not far from
the university campus. It wasn’t anything extravagant—just a small one-
bedroom with cream-colored walls, a narrow balcony overlooking a quiet lane,
and a compact kitchenette—but it felt perfect. For the first time, she had a space
to call her own, untouched by the chaos of shared dormitories or the constant
hum of chatter.
The weekend after she moved in, she dove headfirst into decorating. She hung
soft, pastel-colored curtains by the windows, spread a warm, beige rug across
the floor, and carefully arranged fairy lights along the walls. A small bookshelf
found its spot in the corner of the living room, quickly filling up with her
favorite books and a few potted plants she’d bought on impulse. The kitchen,
though tiny, was soon stocked with spices, utensils, and her cherished collection
of coffee mugs.
Once everything was in place, she collapsed onto the couch, exhausted but
happy. She picked up her phone and started a group video call with her family
and friends: her parents, Meera, Priya, Ananya, and Nina.
As the call connected, Meera immediately exclaimed, “Rhea, this is adorable!
Show us everything!”
Rhea flipped the camera, walking through the apartment. She pointed out the
little balcony where she planned to add a small table and chairs. “And look,”
she said, beaming, “there’s enough sunlight for my plants here!”
Priya chimed in, “I can already see us hanging out there with coffee and snacks.
It’s so you!”
Nina, ever the quiet observer, said, “I love the fairy lights. They make it feel so
warm and cozy.”
Her mom, always practical, added, “Make sure you keep that balcony door
locked at night and don’t forget to clean the kitchen. Small spaces can get messy
fast.”
“Maa, I’ve got it covered! Don’t worry,” Rhea replied, rolling her eyes but
smiling.
“Are you planning to cook here?” Ananya teased. “Because let’s be honest,
Rhea, cooking isn’t really your thing.”

67 | P a g e
68


“Excuse me, I make excellent pasta!” Rhea protested, laughing.
The conversation shifted to everyone sharing updates, but Nina stayed
unusually quiet. Rhea noticed and asked, “Nina, what’s on your mind?”
Nina smiled faintly. “Nothing, just... this apartment suits you, Rhea. It feels like
you’ve found a space where you can really grow.”
Rhea’s heart warmed at the sincerity of Nina’s words. “Thanks, Nina. That
means a lot.”
After everyone signed off, Rhea decided to mark the moment with a small puja.
She lit a diya and placed it near a makeshift altar she’d created on a shelf in the
living room. She offered flowers, lit incense, and whispered a quiet prayer of
gratitude. The soft glow of the diya filled the apartment, making it feel even
more like home.
Later, as the scent of incense lingered in the air, Rhea sat cross-legged on the
floor, soaking it all in. The solitude was comforting, a welcome change from the
bustling dorm life she’d left behind. For the first time in years, she felt at peace.
“This is mine,” she murmured to herself, her voice soft but firm. “This is where
I can finally figure things out.”
That night, after calling her parents again to show them the altar and hearing her
mom’s and dad’s approval “It looks lovely, beta,” Rhea curled up in bed. The
quiet wasn’t empty; it was full of possibilities, of all the things she could
become. She drifted off to sleep with a smile, ready to embrace her future, one
small step at a time.

               Chapter 12: The Twentieth Year


Scene 1: Rhea’s Apartment - The Birthday Eve
The soft glow of the late afternoon sunlight filtered through the curtains as Rhea
stood in front of her mirror, adjusting the dress she had carefully picked out for
her birthday party. The room around her was filled with scattered balloons and
party decorations, the remnants of her half-hearted attempt to prepare for the
event.
She ran her fingers through her hair, staring at her reflection. It had been a few
months since that first strange encounter with Kush. So much had changed in
those months, and yet, there was this feeling deep inside her, something she
hadn’t been able to shake.


Rhea (thinking): It’s been months, and I still haven’t figured it out, have I?


Her phone buzzed on the counter, pulling her from her thoughts. She glanced at
the screen: it was a message from Nina.
Nina (text): "Are you ready for the big day tomorrow, birthday girl? Don’t
forget to send me the address of your new apartment again!"


Rhea smiled at the text, the familiar warmth from her long-time friend
comforting her. Nina had been there through it all—through the confusion with
Kush, the endless late-night conversations about love, life, and dreams.


Rhea quickly typed back:
Rhea (text): "Of course, I’ve got everything set. Can’t wait to see you."
But as she typed, her mind wandered. Her birthday always felt like a time of
reflection—about the year gone by, the milestones, the things she had achieved,
and the things she hadn’t. Like love, she thought. She had convinced herself for
so long that she didn’t need it, that it wasn’t important. But deep down, there
had always been a part of her that wondered—what would it be like to be truly


69 | P a g e
70


understood by someone?


Her phone buzzed again, this time with a memory. It was a picture from last
year’s birthday, the one she had celebrated with Priya and Ananya before
moving out of the dorm. The three of them had stayed up late, decorating their
small dorm room with mismatched streamers and balloons, laughing as they
struggled to get everything just right. Ananya had baked a cake—a little
lopsided but full of heart—and Priya had made sure to get all her favorite
snacks, even though they’d had to sneak in extra food to avoid the dorm's “no
outside food” rule.


Rhea remembered how they’d spent the evening telling stories, joking about the
future, and dancing around the room to their favorite songs, the weight of the
world forgotten for a few hours. For the first time in a long while, Rhea had felt
a deep sense of belonging, surrounded by people who truly cared about her. The
joy of being together had been the greatest gift of all.


Her smile faded slightly as she thought about the contrast to where she stood
now.
Rhea (thinking): It’s different this time. I’m alone tonight, in a new place, with
new challenges ahead. But... I guess I’m ready for it.


She quickly pushed the thought aside, focusing instead on the excitement of
tomorrow. She would be celebrating with her friends, and it felt like the start of
something new—a new chapter.




Scene 2: The Day. The Feels
The morning sunlight poured into Rhea’s apartment, casting a soft golden hue
over the living room. It was her 20th birthday. As the clock ticked closer to noon,
Rhea stood by the window, her fingers lightly tracing the edges of the glass. It
felt like a new beginning like she was standing at the edge of something
significant. The feeling was both exciting and a little overwhelming.

Rhea had never been one to make a big deal out of her birthday, but this year,
everything felt different. She was no longer the teenager she once was, unsure
and navigating life with an unsteady compass. No, she was now entering her
twenties, and with it, a whole new chapter of growth, independence, and maybe
understanding herself in ways she never had before.
The phone buzzed on the counter, pulling Rhea from her thoughts. It was an
incoming video call from her parents.
Rhea (answering the call): “Hi, Maa, Papa!”
Her mother’s face lit up the screen, smiling warmly, with her father peeking
from behind her shoulder.
Mom: “Happy Birthday, beta! Twenty years old! Can you believe it? It feels like
just yesterday we were running behind you to finish your homework.”
Rhea laughed, the warmth of her parents' love filling her heart.
Rhea: “I know, Maa. Time flies, doesn’t it? Thank you for your wishes. It feels...
strange but exciting to be twenty.”
Dad: “Exciting is good! You’re at the perfect age to figure out your dreams and
chase them. Just remember, no matter how old you get, you’ll always be our
little girl.”
Rhea smiled, feeling a lump form in her throat at her father’s words.
Mom: “Have you made plans for today? Are Nina and the others coming over?”
Rhea: “Yeah, Nina’s gonna be here in a while. We’re just going to have a small
celebration. I didn’t feel like throwing a big party this year.”
Mom: “That’s perfect. You’ve always been about meaningful celebrations. And
did you make sure to eat something? Don’t skip your meals just because it’s
your birthday!”
Rhea: “Yes, Maa,” she replied, rolling her eyes playfully. “I made breakfast
earlier. And I’ll order something nice for lunch, I promise.”
Dad: “Good, because you need to keep your energy up! Twenty’s a big year, you
know. It’s when you start truly finding your path. We’re so proud of how far
you’ve come, Rhea.”



71 | P a g e
72


Rhea (smiling): “Thanks, Papa. That means a lot. I couldn’t have done it
without you both.”
Mom: “Alright, beta, we’ll let you go now. Have a wonderful day, and don’t
forget to send us pictures!”
Dad: “And enjoy yourself tonight, but not too much, okay?”
Rhea laughed: “Okay, Papa. Love you both!”
Mom and Dad (in unison): “Love you too!”
As the call ended, Rhea felt a surge of gratitude. Her parents had always been
her anchor, and their unwavering support gave her the strength to take on
whatever came next.
She put the phone down and glanced around her apartment. It was small but
hers. It was a space that had become a reflection of herself—cluttered in places,
clean in others, and filled with personal touches that made it feel like home. It
was also the first birthday she would celebrate without the roommates who had
once filled her life with laughter and chaos.
The phone buzzed again, this time with a message from Nina.
Nina (text): “Happy Birthday, Rhea! 20! Can you believe it? I hope this year
brings you everything you deserve. Can’t wait to celebrate with you tonight. I’ll
be there soon. Love you!”
Rhea’s heart warmed at the message. She quickly typed a reply.
Rhea (text): “Thank you! 20 feels strange, but in a good way. I’m excited to see
you soon. Let’s make it a night to remember!”
As Rhea put her phone down, the doorbell rang. Her heart fluttered in
anticipation. It was Nina, and she was ready to ring in Rhea’s 20th year with her.
Rhea opened the door to Nina’s bright smile and a big hug.
Nina: “Happy Birthday, my best friend! You’re officially in your twenties!”
Rhea laughed as Nina handed her a small gift wrapped in silver paper. It was a
simple gesture, but Rhea knew it was the thought that mattered. They both sat
on the couch, sipping coffee and catching up.
Nina: “So, how does it feel to be twenty?”


72 | P a g e
73


Rhea (thinking for a moment): “It feels... like a fresh start. Like I’m ready to
leave behind all the old versions of myself and figure out who I really am.”



After a while, Nina’s phone buzzed on the table, and she picked it up to check
the incoming message. As she read it, a small frown appeared on her face. Rhea
noticed the change in her expression and leaned forward, her curiosity piqued.
Rhea: "What’s up? You look like you’ve just read bad news."
Nina hesitated for a moment before unlocking her phone and showing Rhea the
message from Meera.
Nina: "It’s from Meera. She’s not going to make it tonight."
Rhea’s face fell as she read the text, her heart sinking a little. She had been
looking forward to having everyone together for her birthday, and now one of
her closest friends couldn’t come.
Rhea: (sighing) "She’s not coming? Why? Is everything okay?"
Nina: "Yeah, it’s just work stuff. She’s really busy and can’t get away, but she
sent you her love. She didn’t want you to feel bad about it. She’s feeling guilty
for not being able to make it."
Rhea: (pausing, then smiling faintly) "I get it. Work can be overwhelming. I just
wanted to have everyone here with me tonight… I guess I’ll have to celebrate
with who’s here."
Nina: "Don’t worry. Meera’s not far in spirit. We’ll make sure this birthday is
still special for you. Plus, it’s the first time we’re doing this in your new place,
so that’s something to celebrate too."
Rhea nodded, trying to shake off the disappointment. As much as she
understood Meera’s situation, it still stung. But with Nina by her side, Rhea
knew she would still have a memorable night.


As the evening approached, the excitement of the night ahead lingered. Rhea,
with Nina by her side, felt the weight of the day slowly lifting. Turning twenty
wasn’t as scary as she’d imagined—it was a chance to grow, explore, love, and
be loved. A whole new journey was unfolding before her.

73 | P a g e
74


Scene 2: The Gathering
It was late evening when the guests started arriving. Rhea had always enjoyed
these celebrations. Her friends surrounded her with laughter and chatter, the
room filled with energy, as they celebrated her birthday in the little apartment
she had moved into.
The décor was simple but elegant—soft fairy lights hung across the ceiling, and
a table was filled with snacks and drinks. The music played in the background,
familiar tunes that everyone hummed along to. It was a celebration, but more
than that, it was a reminder of how far she had come.
As Rhea moved through the crowd, chatting and catching up with people, her
thoughts occasionally drifted back to that day with Kush, but she quickly
pushed them away. He hadn’t been a part of her life in months—after their brief
encounters, they had both moved on. Or at least, that’s what she had convinced
herself.
The doorbell rang, and Nina opened it with a loud cheer.
Nina (grinning): "Guess who’s here!"
Rhea’s heart skipped a beat. She froze for a moment, but then, standing at the
door, was Kush.
He had changed, just like she had. The boy she had met months ago was now a
man, more confident, more settled in his own skin. His eyes, though, still held
that familiar kindness.
And for a moment, as their gazes met, it felt like the months had slipped away,
and she was back to that first day. That same rush of emotion, the same
unexplainable connection flooded her chest.
Kush (smiling): "Hey, Rhea. Happy Birthday!"
She couldn’t help but smile back, the words she had been wanting to say for
years now caught in her throat. She managed a small laugh.
Rhea: "Thank you, Kush. I didn’t expect you to be here."
Kush (shrugging): "Well, you invited me. And I thought it would be good to
catch up."



74 | P a g e
75


Rhea nodded, feeling an unfamiliar warmth spread through her chest. She
hadn’t seen him in such a long time, and the sudden reappearance stirred
something within her. What was this?




Scene 3: Conversations and Reflection
As the night wore on, Rhea found herself beside Kush, sipping a drink as the
party buzzed around them. There was a comfortable silence between them,
something unspoken but understood. They had talked for hours back in the day,
about everything—life, aspirations, fears. It felt like a part of her had missed
this, missed him.
Kush (leaning in slightly): "It’s been a while, hasn’t it? Time flies."
Rhea smiled, nodding in agreement.
Rhea: "Yeah. Feels like everything’s changed, but at the same time, nothing has.
I don’t know… it’s just a weird feeling."
Kush: "I get it. We’ve all changed. We’ve all grown, but some things remain the
same, don’t they?"
Rhea’s eyes met his, and for a moment, the room seemed to fade away. There
was that old feeling, the one she had tried so hard to bury. But now, it was
impossible to ignore.
Rhea (thinking): Why does this always happen when I see him?
She quickly glanced away, focusing on the conversation again, desperate to
ground herself.
Rhea: "I guess some things do stay the same."
They shared a quiet laugh, the moment stretching between them, comfortable,
but loaded with unspoken words. Rhea wasn’t sure what she was feeling
anymore. This feeling—this longing—had never really gone away, had it?
But tonight, it didn’t matter. Tonight was about celebrating, about enjoying the
company of friends, about celebrating the life she had built so far. So, she
pushed those thoughts aside. For now.


75 | P a g e
76


Scene 4: A Toast to the Future
Later in the evening, the time came for the birthday toast. Rhea stood in front of
her friends, her heart full. She raised her glass, smiling at the people who had
supported her, laughed with her, and been there through the ups and downs.
Rhea (cheerfully): "Thank you all for being here tonight. You’ve made this day
unforgettable. To friendship, to laughter, and to the future!"
Everyone raised their glasses in response, clinking them together with a loud
cheer.
Nina (teasingly): "And to Rhea finally finding some love!"
The room burst into laughter, and Rhea’s cheeks flushed. She looked at Kush,
who was watching her with a soft smile. It was funny, really—she had built this
life for herself, this world where love didn’t matter. But now, with him here, it
seemed almost... possible.
For the first time in a long while, Rhea allowed herself to entertain the idea that
love wasn’t just something she could ignore. Maybe it was something she
deserved too.




Scene 5: A Quiet Moment with Kush
Later in the evening, after the last of the guests had left, Rhea stood by the door,
seeing them off. It had been a great night, one of the best birthdays she had had
in a while. But there was still a nagging feeling deep inside her—an unresolved
question that she knew she would have to face sooner or later.
Kush lingered at the door, his hand resting lightly on the frame as he turned to
look at her.
Kush: "It was good seeing you again, Rhea."
Rhea (softly): "Yeah… you too."
For a moment, there was silence. Neither of them knew what to say. It wasn’t
awkward, just... heavy.

76 | P a g e
77


Kush (with a small smile): "Take care, Rhea. Maybe we’ll talk soon."
Rhea (nodding): "Yeah. I’d like that."
As he walked away, Rhea closed the door behind her and leaned against it, her
heart thudding in her chest. Tonight, she had felt something shift again,
something that had always been there, quietly waiting. She wasn’t sure what it
meant, but for the first time in a long while, she wasn’t afraid to wonder.
After the birthday celebration, Rhea felt a deep sense of contentment as she sat
on the couch, scrolling through the pictures she had clicked earlier in the
evening. It was the kind of night that felt just right—Nina and friends by her
side, laughter filling the room, and her new space feeling more like home with
each passing day. She couldn’t wait to share all of it with her parents, especially
since they weren’t there to celebrate with her.
Rhea picked up her phone and dialed her mom's number. The screen lit up with
her mother’s name, and Rhea’s heart warmed as the call connected.
Rhea: "Hi, Mom! Guess what? The birthday party was amazing!"
Mom: "Oh, baby, happy birthday once again! I wish I could’ve been there with
you! How was everything? How’s the new place treating you?"
Rhea: (laughing) "It’s so great, Mom. Honestly, I’ve been feeling so at home
here. Nina was with me along with Priya and Ananya but Meera couldn’t make
it up cause she was piled up with work but it was okay! But we still had a blast.
The place was filled with laughter and good vibes. I really missed having you
guys here, but it still felt special."
Mom: "I’m so happy to hear that. I can’t believe you’re 20 now! You’re
growing up so fast. I wish I could’ve given you a big birthday hug. Did you take
pictures?"
Rhea: (grinning) "Of course! I took so many pictures! I’ll send you some right
now."
Rhea quickly attached a few pictures of the evening—one with Nina laughing
with her, another of the birthday cake, and a few shots of the cozy living room
with the birthday decorations. She sent them over before continuing the
conversation.
Rhea: "I also had this moment when I was looking around the apartment, and I
just realized how much I’ve changed in a year. I feel like I’m stepping into a
77 | P a g e
78


new phase of my life, you know? Not just with my birthday but with
everything—this place, this new chapter. It’s all starting to make sense."
Mom: "Oh, honey, I’m so proud of you. It’s amazing how much you’ve grown,
even though we can’t always be there to see it. You’re finding your own way.
But I miss you so much."
Rhea smiled at her mom's words, feeling a wave of emotion.
Rhea: "I miss you too, Mom. I really do. But I’ll come visit soon, I promise."
The call was warm and filled with love, and as Rhea talked to her mother, she
couldn’t help but feel grateful for the people she had in her life, even if they
were far away. Once the conversation with her mom ended, Rhea called her
father.
Rhea: "Hey, Dad! How are you? I had such a good birthday today."
Dad: "Hey, sweetie! I’m doing well, and I’m so glad to hear that. How was the
celebration? You must have had a lot of fun!"
Rhea: "It was so nice, Dad. Nina and other friends were here with me, and we
had a little birthday dinner. It was simple but perfect. I even took some pictures.
I’ll send them to you, too!"
Rhea sent her dad the same photos, each one capturing a different moment from
her day—her laugh, the cake, and her apartment, which still felt so new.
Dad: "I can’t believe you’re 20 already. Feels like just yesterday I was helping
you pick out your first school supplies. I’m really proud of the woman you’re
becoming."
Rhea: (with a slight chuckle) "You’re making me emotional, Dad. I feel like I’m
growing up so fast too. It’s a bit scary but exciting at the same time."
Dad: "Don’t worry, we’ll always be here for you. No matter how old you get,
you’re still our little girl."
Rhea: "I know, Dad. I love you both so much."
Dad: "We love you too. Can’t wait to see you soon."
Rhea: "Dad, don’t stay up too late at the office. Please go home soon, okay? I
don’t want you working too hard."



78 | P a g e
79


Dad: "I’ll be fine, sweetheart. Don’t worry. I’ll head home soon. Just want to
make sure everything’s in order for the week ahead.
Rhea: “Goodnight Papa”
Dad: “Goodnight Beta. Sleep tight”
As Rhea hung up the phone, a sense of peace settled within her. Despite the
distance, the connection with her parents felt as strong as ever. She sat back on
the couch, looking around her apartment, feeling a little more grounded, a little
more at home. This was just the beginning of her journey.

 Chapter 13: New Beginnings and Unseen Paths


Scene 1: A New Day, A New Start - Rhea’s Morning
The morning sun streamed through the window, casting a soft golden light
across Rhea’s apartment. She had just woken up, still groggy but with a smile
on her face. Last night had been a whirlwind—her birthday, the party, the
fleeting moments with Kush, and the lingering thoughts that kept her awake
long after everyone else had left.
But today, today was different. It felt like a fresh start, like something new was
beginning, even if she wasn’t sure exactly what that was. She stretched lazily,
reaching for her phone on the nightstand.
A string of messages appeared on the screen, mostly from her friends wishing
her a happy birthday, but one stood out. Kush’s!
Meera (text): "I’m so sorry, Rhea. I really wanted to be there, but work got in
the way. I feel bad for not making it, especially on your special day."
Rhea (replying): "It's okay, I totally get it. I know you would’ve been there if
you could. We’ll celebrate together soon."
Meera (answering the reply): "I’ll make it up to you, I swear. Let’s plan
something special for just us when things settle down!"


Kush (text): "Hey, Rhea. I had a great time last night. We should catch up soon.
Take care!"
Rhea smiled to herself, her heart doing that familiar flip. He wasn’t just a
passing thought anymore. He was in her life again, and this time, it felt different.
She couldn’t explain it, but there was a quiet excitement that hummed in her
chest.
Rhea (thinking): What is happening to me?
She quickly replied.
Rhea (text): "Thanks, Kush. It was great seeing you. Let’s catch up sometime."

80 | P a g e
81


As she put her phone down, Rhea went about her morning routine. It was almost
like the world outside had changed too. Her apartment felt lighter, her thoughts
more hopeful. Maybe she had been too focused on avoiding the things that
could change her life—like love. Maybe it was time to open up to something
new.




Scene 2: Rhea Meets Nina for Coffee - The Cafe
Later that afternoon, Rhea met up with Nina at their favorite café. The place
was bustling with activity, filled with the sound of coffee machines steaming
and the chatter of people lost in their own worlds. It was a warm, cozy place
where Rhea often came to think, talk, and sometimes escape.
Nina was already seated at their usual corner table, a steaming cup of coffee in
front of her, her phone in hand. Rhea slid into the seat across from her, taking a
deep breath as she relaxed into the familiar atmosphere.
Nina: "So, how was the rest of the night?"
Rhea chuckled softly, trying to hide the emotions that were swirling inside her.
Rhea: "It was great. Really. But... you know, I can’t stop thinking about it. I
mean, him."
Nina put her phone down, her eyes focused on Rhea with a mixture of concern
and curiosity.
Nina: "Kush? Are you still thinking about him? It’s been several months, Rhea.
You can’t keep living in the past."
Rhea (sighing): "I know, Nina. But something about last night... I can’t shake it
off. It’s like everything came rushing back. And I can’t decide if I should just let
it go or..."
Nina: "Or? Or what? You’re not going to just keep hoping for something that
might never happen, right?"
Rhea bit her lip, unsure how to respond. Nina was right, of course. She had
always been the practical one, the one who believed in logic over feelings. But
this? This felt like something she couldn’t control.


81 | P a g e
82


Rhea: "I don’t know, Nina. It feels different this time."
Nina studied her for a moment before speaking, her voice soft but firm.
Nina: "Look, Rhea. You’re an amazing person, and if Kush can’t see that, then
it’s his loss. But you can’t keep living your life waiting for someone who might
not be on the same page. You deserve someone who sees you, truly sees you,
and doesn’t keep you in limbo."
Rhea nodded, trying to absorb her friend’s words. But deep down, she knew it
wasn’t that simple. There was something between her and Kush, something she
couldn’t just forget. But Nina was right. She couldn’t keep waiting for
something to happen.




Scene 3: A Different Kind of Love - Rhea and Her Mom
The afternoon was turning into the evening when Rhea walked into her
apartment, feeling the weight of the conversation with Nina still lingering in her
mind. She was lost in thought when she heard a voice from the kitchen.
Mom (calling from the kitchen): "Rhea, is that you?"
Rhea smiled softly, the warmth of her mother’s voice always bringing comfort.
She walked into the kitchen, where her mom was busy chopping vegetables for
dinner. The small apartment was filled with the familiar scent of home-cooked
food, and Rhea felt a sense of peace wash over her.
Rhea: "Hey, Mom. How was your day?"
Mom: "Same old, same old. But I’m making your favorite tonight—spaghetti
with garlic bread. You’ve been working so hard lately. You need to take care of
yourself."
Rhea leaned against the counter, watching her mom work. There was something
so soothing about the simplicity of their life. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was real,
and that was all Rhea ever really needed.
Rhea (thinking): I should talk to her about this. She always knows what to say.
Rhea: "Mom, I’ve been thinking about something... about love, actually."
Her mom paused, looking up with a knowing smile.
82 | P a g e
83


Mom: "Ah, I see. I figured something was going on."
Rhea chuckled, a bit embarrassed. She had never been the one to openly talk
about her feelings, especially when it came to relationships.
Rhea: "It’s just... there’s this guy. Well, it’s not even like we’re together or
anything, but... I keep thinking about him. And it’s messing with my head."
Her mom set down the knife and turned to face her, a serious expression on her
face.
Mom: "Rhea, honey. You can’t control love. It happens when it happens. But
you have to ask yourself one thing—does he make you feel like you’re enough?
Does he see you for who you are, not just who he wants you to be?"
Rhea thought about her mom’s words carefully. For the first time, it felt like she
was really hearing them.
Rhea: "I don’t know yet. But I think I need to figure that out, don’t I?"
Mom (smiling): "You do. But remember, no matter what happens, you’ve got a
family who loves you, and you’ve got the strength to take on anything."

Rhea sat silently for a moment, watching her mom stir the sauce on the stove.
The familiar feeling of home wrapped around her, but there was a tug at her
heart. The realization that her mother would be leaving the next morning
suddenly hit her hard.
Rhea: "Mom, you’re leaving tomorrow morning, aren’t you?"
Her voice wavered, and she didn’t try to hide the sadness that crept into her tone.
Mom (turning to her): "I have to, sweetie. I wish I could stay longer, but you
know how things are back home. I promise I’ll come back soon."
Rhea looked at the countertop, her fingers tracing the edge absentmindedly.
Rhea: "Why did you have to come for a few days? You could have stayed a little
more... I don’t know, I just... I don’t want you to go so soon."
Her mom walked over, wiping her hands on the towel, and pulled Rhea into a
gentle hug. She rested her chin on top of Rhea’s head, her arms enveloping her
in a warmth that only a mother’s touch could provide.



83 | P a g e
84


Mom: "I know it’s hard, honey. I didn’t want to leave so quickly either, but
sometimes, we can’t always have things the way we want them. You’re growing
up so beautifully, and I’m proud of you. I need to make sure everything at home
is in order, but I’ll be back before you know it."
Rhea closed her eyes, allowing herself to lean into the comfort of her mother’s
embrace, the weight of her words sinking in. She didn’t want to admit it, but the
thought of her mother leaving made her feel like she was losing a little piece of
herself again.
Rhea (softly): "I miss you already."
Her mother stroked her hair, a soft chuckle escaping her.
Mom: "I’ll miss you too, sweetheart. But you know I’m always here for you,
even when I’m not physically around. You have to be strong, just like I know
you are. You're on your own path now, and I’ll always be cheering for you."
Rhea nodded, wiping away the tears that she hadn’t realized had fallen.
Rhea: "It’s just... sometimes it feels like everything’s changing so fast. I don’t
know if I’m ready for it."
Mom (gently lifting her chin to look at her): "You don’t have to be ready right
this second. Life’s about taking it one step at a time. You’ve always handled
things with grace, and this is no different. We all have our moments of
uncertainty, but remember, you’re never truly alone. I’m just a call away, and no
matter where I am, you’re in my heart."
Rhea took a deep breath, feeling a little lighter. There was something soothing
in her mom’s words as if they had the power to make everything feel a little
more manageable.
Rhea: "Okay, Mom. I’ll try. And I promise to make you proud."
Mom: "You already do, sweetheart. Every single day."
They held each other a little longer before her mom returned to the stove to
finish preparing dinner. The simple act of being together, of sharing a quiet
moment, felt like enough for now. Tomorrow would come, and her mom would
leave, but for tonight, Rhea had the love and support she needed to face
whatever lay ahead.



84 | P a g e
85


Rhea smiled, feeling a warmth in her chest. She didn’t have all the answers, but
she knew she wasn’t alone in this journey. She had people who cared for her,
and who believed in her. And that was a good place to start.




Scene 4: A Surprise Visit (Flashback)
It was a quiet Saturday morning, and Rhea was lying on her bed, scrolling
aimlessly through her phone. The sudden knock on the door startled her.
Rhea (thinking): Who could that be? I wasn’t expecting anyone.
She swung open the door, and her eyes widened in surprise.
Rhea: "Mom?!"
Her mom stood there, a big smile on her face, holding a small bag of homemade
snacks in one hand and her purse in the other.
Mom: "Surprise! You didn’t think I’d wait until semester break to see you, did
you?"
Rhea stepped aside, letting her mom in, her heart swelling with happiness.
Rhea: "This is such a surprise! But wait... where’s Dad?"
Her mom set the bag down on Rhea’s desk and gave a small shrug.
Mom: "You know your father. Work keeps him tied up. He really wanted to
come, but something came up at the last minute. He sends his love, though."
Rhea nodded, a slight pang of disappointment in her chest, but she quickly
brushed it off.
Rhea: "It’s okay. I’m so glad you’re here, Mom. This place already feels a little
more like home."
Her mom sat on the edge of the bed, looking around the room with curiosity.
Mom: "It’s nice. Cozy, but nice. How’s everything going here? Classes?
Friends?"
Rhea sat beside her, hugging her knees to her chest.



85 | P a g e
86


Rhea: "It’s... good. I’ve met some nice people, my friends as you know them
already, and the professors are amazing."
Her mom reached over, placing a comforting hand on her arm.
Mom: "I’m proud of you, Rhea. Moving away from home, starting fresh—it’s
not easy. But you’re doing great. I can see it."
Rhea smiled, her eyes welling up slightly.
Rhea: "I didn’t realize how much I missed you until now. And homemade
food!"
Mom laughed, pulling out the containers from her bag.
Mom: "Well, I brought all your favorites. But only if you promise to tell me
everything—what’s been going on, the good and the bad."
Rhea (teasing): "You drive a hard bargain. But deal!"
The two spent the next hour talking, sharing stories, and laughing, the little
room filled with warmth and the aroma of home.




Scene 5: The Road to Clarity - The Park
As Rhea walked through the park, the soft rustling of leaves and the distant
chirping of birds provided a soothing backdrop to her thoughts. She couldn’t
help but think back to the time spent with her mother over the past few days. It
had been comforting, a reminder of the warmth and security she always felt
when her mom was around. The laughter, the long conversations, and the shared
moments of silence had made her feel more at home than she had in weeks.
But now, as she walked alone, the absence of her mother felt heavier. She had
left early that morning, and Rhea had woken up to an empty apartment, the
silence echoing through the walls. It was only then that she realized how much
she had come to rely on her mom’s presence. The thought of her going back so
soon left a hollow ache in her chest. Despite the independence she had grown
into, there was always a part of her that longed for her mother’s comforting
embrace. And now, that part felt like it was missing again.



86 | P a g e
87


As she walked along the winding paths, she thought about her life—her career,
her friendships, and now, Kush. She wasn’t sure where things were headed, but
she felt like she was at a crossroads, torn between the past and the future.
She paused by a bench and sat down, pulling her knees to her chest. The
sunlight filtered through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground. The
world felt quiet, and for the first time in a long while, Rhea felt like she could
breathe.
In that moment, she realized something important: she didn’t have to have all
the answers right away. It was okay to be uncertain, to be vulnerable. It was
okay to take things one step at a time.
And with that thought, Rhea stood up, ready to face whatever came next—
whether it was love, or something else entirely.




Scene 6: The Unexpected Visitor - Back at Her Apartment
Later that evening, just as Rhea was finishing her work for the day, there was a
knock at the door. She wasn’t expecting anyone, and curiosity piqued, she
opened it.
Standing there, with an unexpected smile, was Kush.
Kush: "Hey, Rhea. I hope I’m not disturbing you."
Rhea’s heart skipped a beat. She had been thinking about him all day,
wondering if their paths would cross again. And here he was, standing at her
door as if the universe had conspired to bring him back into her life.
Rhea (smiling): "No, not at all. What brings you here?"
Kush (grinning): "I thought maybe we could talk. Catch up properly."
As Rhea stepped aside to let him in, she couldn’t help but wonder if this was the
beginning of something new. Something that was meant to be.

Scene 7: The Unexpected Visitor – A Brief Encounter
Kush stepped inside, his presence somehow filling the space with an unfamiliar
energy. Rhea gestured for him to sit on the couch, though both of them
remained standing for a few moments, unsure of what to say next.
Kush: "I, uh, wanted to apologize for earlier. I didn’t mean to just... leave things
like that. I wasn’t sure if I should’ve stayed or... well, you know."
Rhea (slightly amused): "It’s fine, really. You don’t have to apologize. It was a
bit sudden, but I wasn’t expecting a grand gesture or anything."
Kush chuckled softly, shifting his weight nervously. He wasn’t quite sure why
he had come here. There was no real reason—just an impulse, a pull he couldn’t
explain. He could see Rhea’s calm demeanor, but there was a hint of curiosity in
her eyes, a quiet energy that mirrored his own confusion.
Kush: "I’ve been thinking a lot about our last encounter. You seemed different...
like you were searching for something. Maybe... I’m just overthinking it."
Rhea (pausing, then softly): "Maybe. But I suppose we all search for something,
don’t we?"
There was a brief silence. Kush looked at her, his gaze shifting to her eyes, as if
looking for something. Maybe answers. Maybe something more. But he
couldn’t place it.
Kush: "Yeah. I guess we do."
Rhea shifted her position slightly, then let out a small laugh, breaking the
tension.
Rhea (teasingly): "Well, now that we’ve shared some deep thoughts, should we
just call it a day and say goodnight?"
Kush (smiling slightly): "Yeah, I guess so. Didn’t mean to disturb your peace."
Rhea: "No disturbance. It was... nice to see you again."
As Kush stood to leave, there was an unspoken understanding between them, a
moment of connection. Neither of them said it aloud, but they both knew their
paths were meant to cross once more—though neither could predict what would
come next.
Kush: "Take care, Rhea."

88 | P a g e
89


Rhea (smiling softly): "You too, Kush."
As he walked away, Rhea closed the door behind him and leaned against it for a
moment. She couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted. Maybe it
was nothing. Maybe it was everything. Only time would tell.

                Chapter 14: Whispers of Truth


Scene 1: A Quiet Moment with Kush
It was a crisp autumn evening, the kind where the air carried a gentle chill and
the sky blushed with hues of orange and pink. Rhea walked into the campus
library, her bag slung lazily over her shoulder. She didn’t have a specific
purpose for being there—just the need to be surrounded by the quiet hum of
students flipping pages and the faint scent of old books.
As she made her way to her favorite corner, her eyes caught sight of Kush. He
was seated at a table near the window, his back slightly hunched as he scribbled
something in a notebook. He didn’t see her. His focus was unwavering, and
there was a quiet intensity about him that drew her in.
For a moment, Rhea hesitated. She wasn’t sure why she felt nervous, but her
feet didn’t move. Instead, she watched him from a distance, her heart beating
faster with every passing second.
Rhea (thinking): What is he writing? Why does he look so... lost?
Before she could decide whether to approach him, someone else did—a tall girl
with sharp features and an air of confidence. She leaned over Kush’s shoulder,
her voice low but unmistakably familiar.
It was Meera.
Rhea felt a pang in her chest, though she wasn’t sure why. Rhea’s steps faltered
as she overheard Meera laughing softly at something Kush had said. It was then
that the realization hit her like a sudden gust of wind. Her heart skipped a beat.
Meera’s boyfriend... was none other than Kush.
The same Kush she’d tried to push out of her mind. The one who had lingered
in her thoughts, uninvited, for weeks. The one who had, in a strange way, felt
like a quiet presence in her life. And now, here he was—right in front of her, not
just some passing acquaintance but deeply entwined in Meera’s world.
Rhea stood frozen for a moment, feeling as though the ground beneath her feet
had shifted. Her thoughts raced, tumbling over each other. It was all too much.

90 | P a g e
91


She hadn’t expected this and didn’t know how to process it. Meera and Kush? It
seemed impossible, yet the evidence was right there before her eyes.
She turned quickly, her heart pounding. She couldn’t stay there any longer. The
weight of the revelation pressed down on her, and she found herself fleeing the
library, her thoughts a jumbled mess of emotions she couldn’t name.




Scene 2: Nina’s Revelation
Later that evening, Rhea met Nina at a cozy rooftop café overlooking the city.
The other people around and their group were lively, their laughter filling the air
as they shared stories and sipped on steaming mugs of coffee.
But Rhea was quieter than usual, her mind still stuck on the scene at the library.
Nina noticed, as she always did.
Nina (nudging Rhea): "Okay, spill it. What’s going on? You’ve been acting
weird all evening."
Rhea (forcing a smile): "It’s nothing. Just... saw Kush at the library earlier."
Nina raised an eyebrow, her curiosity piqued.
Nina: "And? Did you talk to him?"
Rhea: "No. He was with Meera."
There was a slight pause before Rhea spoke again, her tone carefully neutral.
Rhea took a deep breath, her eyes clouded with confusion and pain. She stared
into her coffee cup, avoiding Nina’s gaze for a moment. Then, slowly, her voice
trembled as she spoke.
Rhea: "Nina... it’s worse than I thought. Meera... her boyfriend... it’s Kush. The
same Kush. The one I’ve been thinking about."
Nina’s eyes widened in shock. She blinked a few times, as if trying to process
what Rhea had just said. Her mouth opened and closed, but no words came out
immediately.
Nina (shocked): "What? No. Wait, you mean... Kush? Meera’s boyfriend is
Kush?"

91 | P a g e
92


Rhea nodded, her heart heavy, her thoughts tangled in a whirlwind of emotions.
She could feel the tears welling up, threatening to spill over.
Rhea (voice shaking): "I didn’t want to believe it, but it’s true. I saw them
together today. And I couldn’t handle it... I just... I never imagined this would
happen. Not like this."
She paused, her thoughts flooding back to a conversation she was a part of with
Meera months ago. The memory made her heart ache even more.
Rhea (voice trembling): "I remember when Meera once was telling that things
weren’t fine between her and her boyfriend. She never said his name, but... I
always thought she was just going through something, maybe having a rough
patch. She said they weren’t on the same page, that they barely talked, and that
she was thinking about ending things. She never told anyone who he was... I
never thought it was Kush. I just... never imagined it."
Nina’s face softened, and she reached across the table to take Rhea’s hand. She
didn’t say anything at first, just sat there, her expression a mix of disbelief and
sympathy.
Nina: "Oh, Rhea… I’m so sorry. I had no idea it was him. That’s so much to
take in."
Rhea let out a choked sob, her tears finally falling freely. She wiped her eyes
quickly, but the floodgates had already opened. The hurt was deep, cutting
through her chest with every sob.
Rhea (whispering through tears): "I don’t even know why it hurts this much.
He’s with her now. He’s happy, I guess. But I... I don’t know how to let go."
Nina pulled Rhea into a hug, wrapping her arms around her as Rhea’s body
shook with emotion. It was the kind of hurt that went beyond words—an aching,
hollow feeling that seemed impossible to fill.
Nina (softly): "You don’t have to let go right now, Rhea. Take your time. But
remember, you’re not alone in this. You’ve got me. You’ve got all of us."
Rhea clung to Nina, feeling her friend’s support like a lifeline. For a moment,
she let herself break down completely, knowing that, in time, she would find the
strength to pick up the pieces again. But for now, she allowed herself to feel
everything—the hurt, the confusion, and the overwhelming weight of seeing
everything she hadn’t expected come crashing down.

92 | P a g e
93


Scene 3: A Twist of Fate
The next day, Rhea decided to focus on herself. She threw herself into her
studies, spent time with her friends, and even joined a poetry workshop on
campus. Writing had always been her solace, and she needed that escape now
more than ever.
It was during one of these inter-class workshops that something unexpected
happened. The instructor, a warm and eccentric woman named Professor Latha,
assigned a group project: write a collaborative poem with someone from the
other class.
To Rhea’s surprise, her partner turned out to be Kush.
Kush (smiling as he approached): "Looks like we’re working together."
Rhea felt her pulse quicken but managed to keep her composure.
Rhea: "Yeah, I guess so."
They found a quiet spot in the corner of the room and began brainstorming ideas.
At first, the conversation was formal, almost awkward. But as they started
sharing thoughts and words, something shifted.
Kush: "You have a way with words, Rhea. It’s like you can see right into
someone’s soul."
Rhea looked at him, startled by the sincerity in his voice.
Rhea: "Thanks. I guess writing is the only way I know how to make sense of
things."
For the next hour, they worked together, their ideas weaving into a poem that
was both raw and beautiful. It wasn’t just a poem—it was a glimpse into their
hearts, into the unspoken thoughts and emotions they both carried.




Scene 4: The Confrontation
After the workshop, as they walked out together, Rhea couldn’t help but ask the
question that had been weighing on her mind.
Rhea (hesitant): "Kush, can I ask you something?"

93 | P a g e
94


Kush: "Sure. What’s up?"
Rhea: "Meera... she’s... Is she important to you?"
Kush stopped walking, his expression unreadable. For a moment, he seemed to
be searching for the right words.
Kush: "Meera’s... complicated. We’ve known each other for a long time, and
there’s a history there. But sometimes, history isn’t enough."
Rhea’s heart ached at the vulnerability in his voice. She wanted to ask more, to
understand what he meant, but she didn’t. Instead, she nodded, her mind racing
with thoughts.




Scene 5: The First Crack
That night, Rhea couldn’t sleep. She kept replaying Kush’s words in her mind,
trying to make sense of them.
At the same time, Kush sat alone in his apartment, staring at the poem they had
written together. He couldn’t explain why, but it felt like Rhea had become a
mirror, reflecting parts of himself he hadn’t acknowledged before.


”In quiet moments, when the world stands still,
I find myself lost in thoughts of you,
A mirror formed, not of glass, but will,
Reflecting on parts I never thought I knew.
Your words, like whispers, echo in my mind,
A poem shared, yet somehow incomplete,
In every line, a version I might find,
Of all I am, though hidden, so discreet.
Through you, I see the things I left behind,
The pieces of my soul I tried to hide,
But now they surface, tangled in my mind,
As if the mirror’s truth I cannot bide.



94 | P a g e
95




And as the night wore on, both of them realized something: their connection
wasn’t just a coincidence. It was a thread, fragile yet unbreakable, pulling them
closer in ways they couldn’t ignore.

               Chapter 15: Echoes of Uncertainty


Scene 1: The Morning After
The sun spilled into Rhea’s room, painting everything in a soft golden hue, like
the universe was trying to warm her heart with the gentle light of a new day. It
was early, but the rays had already stretched through the window, bathing the
room in warmth. She lay sprawled on her bed, her legs tangled in the blanket,
staring up at the ceiling. Her thoughts, as usual, refused to stay in one place. The
events of the previous day kept replaying in her mind—each memory like a
flicker of light, followed by a dark, lingering shadow.
The workshop. The poem. Kush’s words about Meera. They all swirled together
in her mind, a confusing mix of feelings. One moment, she had been genuinely
moved by the beauty of his words, the next she was torn, confused by the idea
of Meera and Kush as a couple. How could it be so complicated? Why did
everything seem like it was happening too fast? The sharp pangs of disbelief
kept coming back to her—how could she have not seen it? How could Meera
have kept it from all her friends for so long?
Rhea turned her head to the side, her eyes catching the stillness of the room.
Everything was quiet. Too quiet. It was in these silent moments that her mind
tended to spin the most.
Her phone buzzed suddenly, pulling her out of the quiet storm of her thoughts.
She glanced at the screen. It was a message from Nina.
Nina (text):
Morning! Got coffee plans? Spill the tea on Kush from yesterday!
Rhea couldn’t help but let out a soft laugh at the message. Of course, Nina knew.
She always did. Nina had a way of sensing when something was off when
Rhea’s thoughts were consumed by something—or someone. She didn’t need to
see Rhea’s face to know what was going on. Rhea could almost hear her voice
in the message, playful and teasing, but with an undercurrent of concern.
Rhea rolled her eyes and smiled despite herself. It was hard to stay upset when
Nina was so quick to pull her out of her spiral. She could feel the weight of

96 | P a g e
97


yesterday’s conversation lifting just a little bit. Nina was always the one who
could make things feel less complicated, less heavy. Rhea quickly typed a reply.
Rhea (text):
Fine. Café Bloom. Be there in 30.




Scene 2: Café Bloom
It was the usual place for their little catch-ups, a cozy café tucked on the corner
of a busy street, away from the chaos of the city. It was quiet, relaxed, and
always had the best lattes. Perfect for discussing whatever was on Rhea’s
mind—whether it was something light, like her latest book obsession, or
something heavier, like the mess that was her current feelings about Meera and
Kush.
Rhea set her phone down on the bedside table, her mind still spinning, but a
little less frantic. She sat up slowly and swung her legs over the side of the bed,
letting her feet touch the cold floor. The sensation grounded her, even if only a
little. She was still reeling from everything that had happened, from the truth
she had discovered the day before. How was she supposed to look at things the
same way now? Meera and Kush—her two worlds—had collided in the most
unexpected way. And yet, there was no going back. The truth had been revealed.
Rhea had seen them together, and it felt like the rug had been pulled out from
under her.
But Nina was waiting, and she knew Nina would be there, as she always had
been, ready to help her figure it out. As Rhea stood up and walked toward her
closet, she pulled her hoodie off the hanger, not really caring what she wore.
She was past the point of needing to impress anyone. Her mind was too full of
everything else to think about clothes.
As she grabbed her bag, the weight of the situation seemed to settle in her chest
once more. She still wasn’t sure how to process the way she felt about Meera,
about Kush, about everything that had happened. But she was certain of one
thing: she needed to talk about it. And Nina was the one person who could help
her make sense of it all.



97 | P a g e
98


Taking a deep breath, she stepped out of her apartment and into the quiet of the
morning streets, the cold air hitting her face and snapping her out of the haze in
her mind. With each step toward the café, she could feel the tension in her
shoulders begin to ease, just a little. Maybe, just maybe, this conversation with
Nina would help her clear the fog in her heart.
Nina sipped her cappuccino, her eyes fixed on Rhea.
Nina: "All right, spill. What’s going on with Kush?"
Rhea hesitated, unsure of how much to share.
Rhea: "We worked on a poem together yesterday. It was... different. I mean, I’ve
written with people before, but this felt personal. And then, I asked him about
Meera."
Nina leaned forward, her interest piqued.
Nina: "And? What did he say?"
Rhea: "He said they have history, but it’s... complicated. He didn’t explain much,
but I could tell there’s more to it."
Nina frowned, her fingers drumming on the table.
Nina: "History or not, you deserve clarity. Don’t let yourself get pulled into
something messy."
Rhea: "I’m not. It’s not like that. I don’t even know what it is."
But even as she said the words, Rhea couldn’t deny the lingering uncertainty in
her heart.




Scene 3: A Shift in Perspective
Later that day, Rhea attended a guest lecture on campus by a renowned author,
Aniket Sharma, whose book on modern relationships had been a bestseller. The
hall was packed, and Rhea found herself sitting next to Kush, who smiled
warmly when he saw her.
Kush: "Hey. Didn’t expect to see you here."
Rhea (smiling back): "I love his work. Figured I could learn something."

98 | P a g e
99


As the lecture progressed, Rhea couldn’t help but notice how engrossed Kush
was. He took notes, his expression thoughtful, occasionally nodding in
agreement with the speaker.
At one point, Aniket said something that struck a chord:
Aniket: "Sometimes, the people we meet aren’t meant to stay in our lives
forever. They’re there to teach us something, to help us grow, and then they
leave. And that’s okay."
Rhea glanced at Kush, wondering if he felt the same way about his relationships.
Did he see Meera as someone who had taught him something but wasn’t meant
to stay? Or was she reading too much into it?




Scene 4: The Party Invitation
A week later, Rhea received an unexpected message from Rohan, one of her
known ones. He was hosting a party at his place and had invited a mix of
students from different departments.
Rohan (text):
Hey Rhea! Party this Saturday at mine. Chill vibe, and good food. Bring friends.
Rhea wasn’t much of a party person, but something about the casual tone made
her consider it. Nina was quick to encourage her.
Nina: "You’ve been too caught up in your thoughts. A party is exactly what you
need to unwind."
Saturday came, and the party was in full swing. The living room was a mix of
loud music, laughter, and the aroma of pizza and snacks. Rhea found herself
mingling with people she barely knew, enjoying the carefree atmosphere.
And then, she saw Kush.
He was leaning against the kitchen counter, chatting with Rohan. Meera wasn’t
with him, and for some reason, that made Rhea’s heart flutter.
Kush (noticing her): "Rhea! Didn’t expect to see you here."
Rhea (smiling): "I could say the same about you."


99 | P a g e
100


They ended up talking in the backyard, away from the noise. The stars above
seemed brighter, and the cool night air carried a sense of possibility.
Kush: "Do you ever think about where you’ll be in five years? What you’ll be
doing?"
Rhea: "All the time. I want to write. To tell stories that matter. What about
you?"
Kush hesitated, his gaze fixed on the ground.
Kush: "I want to figure out who I am. What I really want. It’s harder than I
thought it would be."
Rhea nodded, understanding more than she expected to.




Scene 5: The Twist
As they talked, Meera arrived at the party, her presence instantly commanding
attention. She walked up to Kush, her gaze intense and purposeful. Rhea noticed
her immediately, and a quiet hush seemed to fall over the space between them.
Meera’s eyes briefly flickered over to Rhea, and there was a subtle shift in her
expression, though she quickly masked it.
Meera: "Kush. We need to talk."
Kush glanced at Rhea, his hesitation evident. He opened his mouth to respond
but then nodded slightly, turning back to Meera.
Kush: "I’ll be back."
Before he followed Meera, his gaze lingered for a moment on Rhea, a silent
communication passing between them. Meera, sensing the tension, turned to
Rhea with a forced smile.
Meera: "Rhea, I didn’t expect to see you here. How have you been?"
Rhea stood up straighter, her heart racing as she tried to mask the emotions
bubbling inside her. She smiled, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes.
Rhea: "I’ve been good. And you?"


100 | P a g e
101


Meera gave a nod, clearly trying to maintain the air of composure she always
had. But there was something about her today that felt different—something
Rhea couldn’t quite put her finger on.
Meera: "You never liked parties, Rhea. What changed?"
Rhea turned toward Meera. She managed a small smile, but her heart was
already racing. The question felt too pointed, and Meera’s tone wasn’t lost on
her.
Rhea: "I guess... some things change. Like who you’re talking to, apparently."
Meera (glancing at Kush): "This is my boyfriend, Kush." She said it casually, as
if it were nothing, though the weight of her words seemed to land on Rhea's
chest like a heavy stone.
Rhea blinked, her surprise barely contained. She had heard seen them together,
of course, but hearing it from Meera, spoken so directly, hit her in a way she
hadn’t anticipated.
Rhea (forcing a smile, trying to play it cool): "Oh, I didn’t know. Well, it’s nice
to meet you, Kush."
Her voice faltered for just a second, though she quickly masked it with a polite
nod. Meera didn’t seem to notice, or at least, didn’t acknowledge it. Kush’s eyes
flickered between the two of them, clearly uncomfortable with the sudden
tension in the air. It felt like the room had shifted, as though the truth had been
laid bare in a single, casual statement.
As he followed Meera inside, Rhea felt a pang of unease. She didn’t know what
their conversation was about, but something told her it wasn’t good.
Rhea’s eyes followed Kush as he disappeared into the crowd with Meera, her
heart sinking deeper with every step. Her mind replayed the moments that had
once seemed innocent. It was as if everything had been in plain sight, but she
hadn’t seen it until now.
The pieces of the puzzle that had never quite fit before were now falling into
place. Rhea felt the sting of realization, a heavy weight settling in her chest.
How had she never put it together? The way they looked at each other, the way
Meera had always been there for Kush, the way they had always seemed so
close. But Rhea had never thought to ask, never suspected there was something
more than friendship between them.

101 | P a g e
102


Her eyes welled up, and she quickly blinked away the tears, angry at herself for
not noticing sooner. How had she missed this? How had Kush kept this from her?
She thought of all the moments they had shared, the late-night conversations,
the smiles, the laughs—but none of it had ever hinted at the truth.
As the realization hit, she couldn’t stop the rush of emotions that flooded over
her. The hurt, the confusion, the betrayal—Rhea had always believed that she
could trust Kush, that he was different. But now, standing here alone, she
couldn’t help but feel foolish for not seeing it sooner.
With a shaky breath, she turned away from the scene, needing space to process
everything that was happening. But the more she tried to push the thoughts
away, the more they clung to her, refusing to let go.
Back inside, the party continued, but Rhea couldn’t shake the feeling that things
were about to change—perhaps in ways she wasn’t prepared for.

            Chapter 16: Fragments of Reflection


Scene 1: The Rain’s Prelude
The sky was a canvas of swirling gray, the air thick with the promise of rain.
Rhea walked through the empty campus pathways, her footsteps echoing faintly.
She had stayed back after a late group meeting, her mind heavy with thoughts
she couldn’t articulate.
In the distance, the first drops of rain kissed the earth, the petrichor weaving its
way through the air. Rhea quickened her pace, but the drizzle turned into a
downpour, drenching her before she could find cover. She laughed—a soft,
unguarded sound—at the absurdity of it all.
And then she saw him.
Kush was sitting on the steps of the library, a notebook in hand, seemingly
unbothered by the rain soaking him. His shirt clung to his frame, his hair
plastered to his forehead, but his focus was unbroken.
Rhea (calling out): "Hey! You’re going to catch a cold."
Kush looked up, startled, and then smiled—a smile that felt like the sun
breaking through storm clouds.
Kush: "Couldn’t resist the mood. Rain makes everything more poetic, doesn’t
it?"
Rhea walked over, shaking droplets from her hair.
Rhea: "Only if you’re not the one getting drenched. What are you writing?"
Kush hesitated, then handed her the notebook. The pages were filled with
sketches and snippets of text—fragments of thoughts that seemed to mirror the
chaos of the rain.
Kush: "Just... trying to make sense of things."
As they sat there, the rain softened, wrapping them in a cocoon of quiet
intimacy.


103 | P a g e
104


Scene 2: A Journey into the Past
The next morning, Rhea woke with a sense of curiosity gnawing at her. She
realized how little she truly knew about Kush beyond their fleeting interactions.
What was it about him that drew her in? She couldn't quite pinpoint it, but there
was something about his presence that felt... different. Despite the fact that he
was committed to Meera—her friend, no less—Rhea couldn’t shake the feeling
that there was still something unresolved inside her.
Why does his smile linger in my mind? she wondered, staring out the window at
the morning light filtering through the curtains. I shouldn't be thinking about
him, not after what Meera said. He's hers, and I should respect that. But why do
I keep wondering what it would be like to talk to him, to really understand him?
The thoughts were intrusive, and Rhea found herself pushing them away as
quickly as they came. Yet, no matter how much she tried to refocus her mind,
she couldn't help but ask herself: What is it about him that keeps me wondering?
She knew she shouldn’t let it bother her, especially since Meera and Kush were
a couple, but the pull was undeniable. Rhea felt caught between her loyalty to
her friend and the undeniable curiosity about the connection she felt with him.
Maybe it’s nothing, she thought, trying to convince herself. Just a passing
thought. Just... a little curiosity. But I won’t let it affect me.
Her answer came in the form of an unexpected encounter with Ayaan, Kush’s
childhood friend, during lunch in the campus cafeteria.
Ayaan: "Kush? He’s an enigma, isn’t he? Always has been."
Rhea (curious): "What do you mean?"
Ayaan leaned back, a wistful smile on his face.
Ayaan: "He’s the kind of guy who carries the weight of the world without ever
letting it show. His dad wanted him to join the family business, but Kush... he’s
always been a dreamer. Art, literature, music—they’re his escape."
Rhea felt a pang of empathy. She had always admired people who dared to
follow their passions, even when the world expected otherwise.
Rhea: "What about Meera?"
Ayaan’s expression darkened slightly.


104 | P a g e
105


Ayaan: "They go way back, but it’s complicated. She’s... not an easy person to
be with. But Kush? He sees the best in everyone, even when they don’t deserve
it. They've been together since they were halfway through 11th grade. Back then,
it was so simple—just two kids in love, all bright-eyed and full of dreams.
Everyone thought they were perfect for each other, and maybe they were, back
then. But now... now, it’s hard to understand them. They’ve changed. The love
they have isn’t the same as it used to be. It’s like they’ve become two
completely different people, stuck in something that doesn’t quite fit anymore."
Ayaan paused, his expression reflecting a mix of confusion and concern. "Kush
is still that sweet, hopeful guy who believes in people, in love. But Meera?
She’s different now. I don’t think she even knows who she is anymore. And yet...
they’re still together, trying to make it work, even though everyone can see the
cracks in their relationship."
Rhea absorbed his words, feeling a strange mixture of sympathy for Kush and
an uncomfortable curiosity about the situation. "But if they’re not right for each
other anymore, why stay?" she asked, more to herself than Ayaan.




Scene 3: The Rooftop Moment
That evening, Rhea found herself on the rooftop of her apartment, gazing at the
city lights twinkling in the distance. The air was crisp, carrying the faint hum of
traffic and the occasional laughter from nearby rooms.
Kush appeared as if summoned by her thoughts.
Kush: "Mind if I join you?"
Rhea nodded, her heart skipping a beat.
Kush: "This view... it always reminds me of how small we are in the grand
scheme of things."
Rhea (teasing): "Wow, deep. Do you rehearse these lines?"
Kush chuckled, the sound warm and unguarded.
Kush: "No rehearsals. Just thoughts. I think too much sometimes."
They sat in companionable silence, the world around them fading away.

105 | P a g e
106


Rhea: "Kush... do you ever feel like you’re searching for something, but you
don’t know what it is?"
Kush turned to her, his eyes reflecting the glow of the city.
Kush: "Every day. But I think that’s what keeps us alive—the search."
Rhea didn’t reply. She didn’t need to. In that moment, she felt like she had
found a piece of the puzzle she didn’t know she was missing.




Scene 4: The Shock
The next day, as Rhea sorted through her locker, she found an envelope tucked
between her books. Inside was a sketch of her—lost in thought, her fingers
lightly grazing the edge of a notebook.
It was Kush’s work. She recognized the style immediately.
Beneath the sketch were the words:
"In a world full of noise, you’re the silence that speaks volumes.- When the
heart doesn’t speak"
Rhea’s heart raced, her mind a whirlwind of emotions. Was this just Kush being
his poetic self, or was there something more?
As she turned the sketch over, she noticed a faint imprint on the back—an
unfinished sentence, hurriedly scribbled and erased.
"Sometimes, I wonder..."
Wonder what?
Rhea didn’t know, but for the first time in years, she didn’t feel like running
from the uncertainty.

                Chapter 17: Sketches And Secrets


Scene 1: A Morning of Quiet Resolve
The morning sun filtered through the thin curtains of Rhea's room, casting
streaks of warm light on her desk, cluttered with books, a half-empty coffee
mug, and her journal. She hadn’t been able to sleep much after finding Kush’s
sketch the night before.
Sitting cross-legged on her bed, Rhea traced the lines of the drawing for what
felt like the hundredth time. The details were so vivid—the faint curls of her
hair, the slight tilt of her head. Kush had captured her as if he truly saw her, not
just how she appeared but something deeper.
Her phone buzzed, breaking her reverie. It was a text from her friend, Ananya.
Ananya: "Meeting in 20! Don’t be late, drama queen. We’re finalizing the
cultural fest lineup."
Rhea sighed, tucking the sketch safely into her journal before heading out.




Scene 2: The Cultural Fest Meeting
The student council room buzzed with energy. Posters, props, and folders were
scattered across every surface. Ananya, with her usual fiery enthusiasm, was
leading the discussion.
Ananya: "All right, people! Let’s finalize the headliners for the event. Rhea,
what’s your take on the closing performance?"
Rhea, distracted, blinked at her.
Rhea: "Huh? Oh... uh, maybe we could bring in someone local? Give it a more
personal touch?"
Ananya (raising an eyebrow): "Earth to Rhea? You’ve been spacing out all
morning. What’s up?"


107 | P a g e
108


Before Rhea could respond, the door swung open, and Kush walked in, carrying
a stack of music sheets. His sudden appearance sent a ripple of awareness
through her.
Kush (grinning): "Sorry, late as always. Got caught up in rehearsals."
Ananya waved him over.
Ananya: "Perfect timing! Kush, can you perform something acoustic for the
final night? Rhea was just saying we need a personal touch."
Kush (glancing at Rhea): "If Rhea’s behind it, I’m in."
Rhea felt her cheeks flush but quickly masked it with a casual shrug.
Rhea: "No pressure, though."




Scene 3: Lunch with Layers
Later that afternoon, Rhea found herself in the campus café with Ananya and
Ayaan. The café was bustling as usual, the aroma of coffee mingling with the
faint hum of conversations.
Ayaan (teasing): "You’ve been weirdly quiet today. What’s going on? A secret
admirer?"
Rhea (rolling her eyes): "Yeah, because that’s so likely."
Ananya leaned in, her tone conspiratorial.
Ananya: "Don’t think we haven’t noticed the Kush effect. You’re not exactly
subtle, Rhea."
Rhea choked on her iced coffee, glaring at her friends.
Rhea: "Can we not make everything about him? He’s just... a nice guy, okay?"
Ayaan smirked, clearly unconvinced.
Ayaan: "A nice guy who sketches you in his free time?"
Ananya gasped dramatically.
Ananya: "Wait, what? Spill. Now."


108 | P a g e
109


Rhea groaned, realizing she wasn’t getting out of this.
Rhea (reluctantly): "He left this sketch in my locker. It’s nothing. Probably just
a random thing he does for everyone."
Ayaan: "Right. Because Kush is known for randomly sketching people. Totally."
Ananya’s expression softened, her usual teasing replaced by genuine curiosity.
Ananya: "Do you like him, Rhea? Like, really like him?"
Rhea hesitated, her fingers tracing the edge of her coffee cup.
Rhea: "I don’t know. It’s... complicated. He feels like someone I’ve known
forever, even though I barely know him. But what’s the point? He has a
girlfriend though”
Ayaan and Ananya exchanged a quick, knowing glance feeling pitty for Rhea
Ananya ( in her mind ): “I know you are talking about Meera”




Scene 4: Meera’s Appearance
As the trio chatted, Meera entered the café, her presence commanding attention.
Dressed impeccably, she exuded confidence, but her sharp gaze and clipped
tone carried an edge that made people tread carefully around her.
She spotted Kush at a corner table, and without hesitation, walked over.
Meera: "You’re late for the practice meeting. Again."
Kush, unruffled, looked up from his notebook.
Kush: "Got caught up. I’ll be there in a bit."
Meera crossed her arms, her irritation evident.
Meera: "You’re always getting caught up. Maybe prioritize things that actually
matter?"
Rhea, watching from her table, felt a pang of discomfort. She couldn’t quite
place why, but seeing Kush like this—subdued, almost apologetic—didn’t sit
right with her.
Ayaan (muttering to Rhea): "And that’s why she’s a walking storm cloud."
109 | P a g e
110


Rhea stifled a laugh, but her thoughts lingered on the interaction.




Scene 5: The Library Encounter
Later that evening, Rhea found herself in the library, searching for a reference
book. The quiet atmosphere was a stark contrast to the day’s chaos, and she
welcomed the stillness.
As she browsed the shelves, she heard Kush’s voice.
Kush: "Looking for something specific, or just pretending to be studious?"
Rhea turned to find him leaning against the next shelf, a playful smile on his
face.
Rhea: "Definitely pretending. You caught me."
They stood there for a moment, the silence between them charged but
comfortable.
Rhea (hesitant): "Kush... why did you leave that sketch in my locker?"
Kush’s expression shifted, his usual ease replaced by something more serious.
Kush: "Because sometimes, words aren’t enough. And I guess... I wanted you to
see how I see you."
Rhea’s heart skipped a beat, her mind racing.
Rhea: "You’re... confusing, you know that?"
Kush chuckled softly.
Kush: "Life’s confusing. But maybe that’s what makes it interesting."




Scene 6: A Twist of Fate
As Rhea left the library that night, her thoughts a whirlwind of emotions, she
bumped into a senior student who handed her an envelope.
Senior: "This is for you. Kush asked me to give it to you."

110 | P a g e
111


Inside was a folded note:
"Meet me at the amphitheater tomorrow evening. There’s something I need to
tell you."
The words lingered in her mind long after she reached her room. What could he
possibly want to say? Why couldn’t he just text?




111 | P a g e
112



        Chapter 18: Whispers Beneath the Stars


Scene 1: The Invitation
The next evening arrived with the kind of stillness that hinted at something
momentous. The campus amphitheater was bathed in soft, golden light from the
lampposts lining the pathway. Rhea’s steps were measured as she approached
the open space. Her mind buzzed with questions—what did Kush want to tell
her? Why did he choose the amphitheater?
As she reached the steps, she noticed Kush sitting in the middle row, his back to
her. He seemed lost in thought, sketchbook balanced on his lap.
Rhea (softly): "Is this your secret lair, or do you invite everyone here?"
Kush turned, startled for a moment before breaking into his characteristic grin.
Kush: "Only the special ones. You’re late, by the way."
Rhea (sitting beside him): "Fashionably. What’s this about, Kush?"
Kush closed his sketchbook, a thoughtful expression replacing his usual
playfulness.
Kush: "I needed to thank you."
Rhea (raising an eyebrow): "For what? I didn’t do anything."
Kush: "You reminded me what it feels like to see the world differently. To not
just live it but to observe it."
Rhea tilted her head, confused yet intrigued.
Rhea: "That’s cryptic, even for you."
Kush hesitated as if searching for the right words.
Kush: "Sometimes, we meet people who make us question things we thought
were certain. You’re that person for me, Rhea."




112 | P a g e
113


Scene 2: A Late-Night Stroll
Their conversation flowed effortlessly as they moved from the amphitheater to
the campus gardens. The air was crisp, filled with the earthy scent of freshly
watered grass.
Rhea: "You know, you’re annoyingly good at making people feel special."
Kush (chuckling): "It’s not a bad trait, is it?"
Rhea (teasing): "Debatable. People might start thinking you’re in love with
them."
Kush stopped, turning to look at her with a seriousness that caught her off guard.
Kush: "And what if I told you love doesn’t always mean what people think it
does?"
Rhea felt a lump rise in her throat but pushed it down, masking her emotions
with a laugh.
Rhea: "You should write poetry. You’re wasting your talent with architecture."
They continued walking, their words light but the undercurrent of tension
unmistakable.




Scene 3: The Cultural Fest Buzz
The next day brought the usual hustle and bustle of campus life. With the
cultural fest only a week away, everyone was scrambling to finalize their
respective tasks.
Rhea found herself in the green room, helping Ananya and Ayaan sort costumes
for the drama club. The room was a chaotic mess of fabrics, props, and hastily
scribbled notes.
Ananya: "Rhea, pass me that box of paintbrushes. And for the love of God, keep
that dress away from Ayaan. He’s already stained two with coffee."
Ayaan (mock offended): "Excuse me, I’m a connoisseur of caffeine. These
things happen."


113 | P a g e
114


The banter was interrupted by a knock on the door. Kush peeked in, holding a
stack of posters.
Kush: "Am I interrupting, or can I add to the chaos?"
Ananya waved him in without hesitation.
Ananya: "You’re officially part of the chaos now. Welcome."
Kush handed the posters to Rhea, their fingers brushing briefly. She pretended
not to notice, though her heart had other ideas.
Kush (smirking): "Careful with those. They’re fresh off the press."
Rhea (rolling her eyes): "I’ll try not to ruin your masterpiece."




Scene 4: A Twist in the Tale
As the day wore on, Rhea couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that something
was off. It wasn’t until she overheard a conversation between Meera and a
group of her friends that the pieces started falling into place.
Meera (laughing): "Kush thinks he’s so clever, keeping secrets. But he’s
predictable. Always chasing things he can’t have."
Rhea froze, her mind racing. What did she mean by that?
Later, as she sat in the library, her journal open but her mind elsewhere, Kush
appeared out of nowhere, pulling up a chair beside her.
Kush: "You’ve been avoiding me."
Rhea (startled): "What? No, I haven’t."
Kush: "You’re a terrible liar, Rhea."
She sighed, closing her journal.
Rhea: "It’s not about avoiding you. I just... I don’t know where I fit into your
life, Kush. And I don’t think you do either."
Kush’s expression softened.
Kush: "You’re right. I don’t have all the answers. But I know that meeting you
changed something for me. And that’s not something I want to ignore."
114 | P a g e
115


Their conversation hung in the air, unresolved but heavy with meaning.




Scene 5: The Storm Brewing
The sky had been overcast all day, a heavy grey blanket hanging low. By the
time Rhea stepped out of the library, the first few drops of rain had already
started to fall, sharp and quick. She didn’t bother to open her umbrella. There
was something almost cathartic about being caught in the rain. The wetness
seeped into her skin, the coldness matching the churn in her chest. As she
walked, her steps felt unsteady, her mind heavy with thoughts that refused to
settle.
Why does it have to be so complicated?
She looked down at the journal clutched tightly in her hand, the sketch tucked
away like a secret she wasn’t sure she wanted to keep anymore. It was almost as
if the paper could feel her confusion, the ink lines somehow mirroring the storm
inside her.
He’s with Meera... but it doesn’t make sense. Why am I thinking about him this
much?
Rhea couldn’t make sense of it. She had spent so many days dismissing the pull
she felt toward him. She knew he was with Meera, and yet something about
him—his smile, the way he looked at her sometimes—had made her heart beat
faster. It felt like a puzzle missing a piece, but maybe that piece was never
meant to fit.
You’re just being foolish, Rhea. He’s happy with her, and you need to let it go.
The rain grew heavier, soaking her through, but she didn’t care. She kept
walking, the streets dark and empty, the only sound of her own footsteps and the
relentless drumming of the rain.
Maybe I just need to stop thinking about him. He’s not going to leave Meera for
me. He’s not... I don’t even know what I’d want if he did. What’s the point?
But as soon as the thought crossed her mind, she felt the weight of it—how her
heart lurched at the idea of him being with someone else, even though she


115 | P a g e
116


hadn’t even considered what it would mean for her to be with him. It wasn’t
supposed to matter, but it did. It mattered more than she wanted to admit.
Maybe I should just stop... Stop caring, stop thinking about him, stop imagining
what could be. It's not mine to have.
She paused for a moment, standing in the middle of the street, letting the rain
wash over her. She let out a shaky breath, feeling the sting of the cold on her
skin, and she wiped her wet face with the back of her hand.
Why is this so hard?
Rhea sank onto a bench under a streetlight, her journal still pressed tightly
against her chest. The sound of the rain, the gentle pounding of water against
the pavement, seemed to amplify everything in her mind. She felt small against
the vastness of everything happening around her.
Maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m just overthinking it. It’s not like we even really
know each other. We barely talk. Why am I so affected by a stupid sketch?
But deep down, she knew it wasn’t just about the sketch. It was about how Kush
had seen her. How, for a fleeting moment, he had made her feel seen in a way
that no one else had. And now, with Meera in the picture, that feeling seemed
distant, unattainable. She felt a wave of frustration wash over her.
It’s not supposed to matter. I’m not supposed to care. But I do. And I don’t know
why.
The tears came then, not in great sobs, but as quiet, steady drops that mixed
with the rain. Rhea let herself cry, not out of sadness, but out of sheer frustration.
She wasn’t crying for Kush. She was crying because her heart didn’t make sense,
because her feelings didn’t fit into the neat little boxes she had tried to place
them in. Life wasn’t following the rules she had set, and it terrified her.
Maybe I’m just scared. Scared that I’ll never feel like this again. Scared that
this feeling of... connection, it’s just a dream. A fleeting moment.
She sat there for a long time, letting the rain soak through her clothes, the world
around her blurring into something both familiar and foreign at the same time.
Eventually, she stood, wiped her face, and took a deep breath. The storm inside
her wasn’t gone, but at least for the moment, she could face it.
I’ll figure this out. I have to.


116 | P a g e
117


With that thought, she straightened her shoulders and walked back toward her
apartment, the rain now a backdrop to the quiet storm still brewing in her heart.

                Chapter 19: Threads of the Unsaid


Scene 1: The Festive Chaos
The cultural fest was in full swing, the campus unrecognizable beneath colorful
banners, fairy lights, and the buzz of hundreds of students milling about. Stalls
selling everything from handmade crafts to piping hot snacks lined the
walkways. A stage stood proudly at the center, where live performances
competed with the chatter and laughter of the crowd.
Rhea found herself managing the literary corner—a mix of book stalls, open
mic spaces, and a small poetry competition. She wore a crisp white kurta with
blue embroidery, her hair loosely braided, and her hands adorned with ink
smudges from last-minute prep work.
Ananya (rushing in): "Rhea, where are the bookmarks? The DIY stall is about to
riot!"
Rhea (grinning): "Relax, Sherlock. They’re in that brown bag under the table."
As Ananya dove for the bag, Kush appeared, balancing a tray of drinks. He was
dressed casually in a grey t-shirt and jeans, looking every bit the quintessential
campus heartthrob.
Kush: "I thought the literary team could use a caffeine boost."
Rhea (teasing): "Bribery now? What’s next, Kush, carrying my books?"
Kush (shrugging): "Depends on how heavy they are."
Their banter was interrupted by the arrival of Meera, who seemed to sweep into
the space like a storm. She was dressed impeccably, her hair styled into loose
curls that framed her sharp features.
Meera: "Kush, there you are. I need you at the main stage. Now."
Kush glanced between Rhea and Meera, clearly torn.
Kush: "Can it wait? I’m helping here."
Meera (scoffing): "It’s not a request, Kush. It’s important."


118 | P a g e
119


Without waiting for his reply, she walked off, her heels clicking against the
pavement. Kush gave Rhea an apologetic look.
Kush: "Duty calls. Save me a coffee?"
Rhea watched him go, her smile fading.




Scene 2: The Open Mic Stage
Later that afternoon, Rhea found herself at the open mic stage, seated with a
group of students as a singer performed a soulful rendition of a popular Hindi
song. The crowd swayed to the melody, their faces glowing under the fairy
lights.
Ayaan nudged her.
Ayaan (whispering): "You should go up there."
Rhea (laughing): "And do what? Trip over the mic?"
Ayaan: "No, recite something. You’ve got that writer thing going for you. Give
them a taste of it."
Rhea shook her head but couldn’t help feeling tempted. Her fingers itched to
hold the mic, to share her words with strangers who might understand them
better than anyone else.
As the singer finished, the emcee called for the next performer. Rhea surprised
even herself by raising her hand.
Emcee (grinning): "Looks like we have a volunteer! Come on up."
The audience clapped politely as Rhea climbed the stage, her heart pounding.
She adjusted the mic and took a deep breath.
Rhea: "This is... a piece I wrote a while ago which is yet to be completed. It’s
called The Boy."
Her voice trembled at first, but as the words flowed, she felt a surge of
confidence. She spoke about longing, about connections that didn’t need labels,
about the spaces between people that were filled with unspoken words. The
crowd was silent, hanging on every line.

119 | P a g e
120


When she finished, there was a moment of stunned silence before applause
erupted. Rhea stepped off the stage, her face flushed but her heart light.




Scene 4: The After Party
As the sun dipped below the horizon, the campus transformed. The central
courtyard, usually a quiet, tranquil spot, was now alive with energy. Strings of
fairy lights hung between the trees, casting a warm, golden glow over the
gathering. A makeshift dance floor had been set up, and music reverberated
through the air, filling the night with an electric vibrancy. The sound of laughter
and cheerful chatter mixed with the beats, creating a symphony of celebration.
Rhea stood near the edge of the crowd, watching as her friends dived into the
festivities. Ananya was already in the middle of the dance circle, arms flailing
dramatically, her laughter louder than the music. Ayaan joined in, pulling her
into his twirls Nina and Priya laughing at a scenario and before Rhea could
decide whether to join them or not, Ananya spotted her from across the circle.
Ananya (grinning): "What are you waiting for? Come on!"
Before Rhea could protest, she was pulled into the group. The warmth of the
evening air, the thrill of the music, and the infectious energy of her friends
swept away her hesitations. She laughed, throwing herself into the rhythm of the
crowd, spinning and swaying, her body moving as if it had always belonged
here. For the first time in a long while, she let go of the weight in her chest, her
thoughts drifting away with each step.
And then, just like that, there he was—Kush. He emerged from the crowd with
that same effortless ease, his presence almost magnetic, drawing attention
without trying. Rhea's heart skipped a beat, but she quickly brushed the feeling
aside.
Kush (extending his hand, his smile playful): "May I?"
Rhea froze for a second, a brief hesitation crossing her mind. The dance circle
was still moving, people laughing, the music thumping, but all she could hear
was the quiet thrum of her heartbeat in her ears. He was looking at her
expectantly, his hand outstretched, an invitation that seemed casual, yet filled
with something more. Her eyes flickered toward Ananya and Ayaan, who both

120 | P a g e
121


had amused grins on their faces. Without fully understanding why, Rhea reached
out and placed her hand in his.
They slipped into the rhythm of the dance, their movements syncing effortlessly.
It was as though they’d danced together a thousand times before, the distance
between them shrinking with each beat. The noise around them seemed to fade,
leaving just the two of them in their own little world, surrounded by the soft
glow of the lights and the gentle hum of the music.
Kush (leaning close to her ear, his voice warm): "You’re full of surprises today."
Rhea’s lips curled into a smirk, her eyes meeting his, sharp and teasing.
Rhea (playfully): "And you’re full of assumptions."
Kush laughed, the sound easy and free, before spinning her under his arm, their
hands never letting go. The circle of dancers spun around them, but Rhea only
had eyes for him. She couldn’t help but notice the way he moved with such
confidence, the way his gaze lingered on hers a little too long, and the way their
shared moments seemed to slip into something more, something deeper.
Meanwhile, across the dance circle, Meera stood still, watching them closely.
Her eyes flickered between Kush and Rhea, studying their every movement.
She didn’t say a word, but the intensity of her gaze didn’t go unnoticed. She
seemed to be caught somewhere between curiosity and caution, but her lips
remained sealed, her silence a quiet observer to the unfolding chemistry.
As the night wore on, their banter continued, easy and effortless. But beneath
the lighthearted teasing, there was an undeniable shift—a pull between them
that neither could deny. They weren’t just dancing anymore. They were crossing
that line, inch by inch, from something familiar and comfortable into something
unknown, yet exciting.
Rhea felt the shift but didn’t know what to make of it. She didn’t want to, either.
After all, they were just two people sharing a moment, a dance—nothing more,
nothing less. But as the music played on and the night unfolded, she found
herself wanting more. And somehow, she knew he did too.




121 | P a g e
122


Scene 4: A Quiet Moment
As the party wound down, Rhea found herself on the rooftop of the library, the
campus sprawling out before her like a city of stars. Kush joined her, holding
two cups of coffee.
Kush: "Thought you might need a refill."
Rhea: "You’re persistent, I’ll give you that."
They sat in comfortable silence, the weight of the day settling over them.
Rhea (softly): "Do you ever feel like you’re living someone else’s life?"
Kush: "All the time. But then I meet people like you, and it feels like maybe I’m
exactly where I’m supposed to be."
Rhea looked at him, her heart aching with emotions she couldn’t name.
Rhea: "You’re infuriating, you know that?"
Kush (grinning): "And yet, here you are."

                Chapter 20: Fractured Reflections


Scene 1: A Day of Distances
The morning air was crisp, the remnants of the festival still evident in the stray
decorations fluttering across the campus. Rhea was seated at her favorite corner
in the library, her laptop open but untouched. Her fingers traced invisible
patterns on the table as her mind replayed last night’s rooftop conversation with
Kush.
Nina dropped into the seat opposite her, her expression a mix of excitement and
concern.
Nina: "You’ve been AWOL all morning. Everything okay?"
Rhea (distracted): "Yeah, just... thinking."
Nina(teasing): "Let me guess—about a certain someone with a knack for
showing up at the right moments?"
Rhea’s silence was answer enough.
Nina: "You’ve got to be careful, Rhea. People like him... they’re not easy to
figure out."
Rhea nodded, but her thoughts were elsewhere. She couldn’t shake the feeling
that something about Kush wasn’t adding up, that there were parts of his life she
wasn’t seeing.




Scene 2: Kush’s World
Across campus, Kush was immersed in a heated conversation with Meera.
Meera (angrily): "You’re getting too close to her, Kush. Don’t forget what’s at
stake."
Kush (calmly): "It’s not about you or her, Meera. It’s about me trying to figure
things out."

123 | P a g e
124


Meera: "Figure things out? You’ve got responsibilities, commitments. You can’t
just wander off chasing... whatever this is."
Kush sighed, running a hand through his hair.
Kush: "I’m not chasing anything. I’m just trying to be honest—with myself,
with everyone."
Meera crossed her arms, her expression softening slightly but still guarded.
Meera: "Just remember, you don’t get to choose when things fall apart."
The tension between them was palpable, hinting at a history and a connection
more complicated than Rhea could imagine.




Scene 3: The Unraveling
Later that day, Rhea was on her way to the student café when she spotted Kush
talking to Meera outside the auditorium. Their body language was intense—
Meera’s arms were crossed, her gaze sharp, while Kush’s expression was
unreadable.
Rhea hesitated, her chest tightening with a mix of emotions she didn’t want to
name. She turned on her heel and walked away, her steps quick and deliberate.


That evening, Nina found Rhea sitting alone on the steps leading to the
amphitheater, a half-empty coffee cup beside her.
Nina(gently): "Want to talk about it?"
Rhea (bitterly): "What’s there to talk about? He’s clearly... whatever, it doesn’t
matter."
Nina: "It does matter. You wouldn’t be sitting here looking like someone just
spoiled the ending of your favorite book if it didn’t."
Rhea laughed despite herself, the sound hollow.
Rhea: "I don’t know what’s happening to me, Ni. I don’t even know if I want to
figure it out."


124 | P a g e
125


Nina placed a comforting hand on her shoulder.
Nina: "You don’t have to figure it out alone, you know."




Scene 4: The Confrontation
The next day, Rhea and Kush crossed paths near the library. Kush’s face lit up
when he saw her, but her expression was guarded.
Kush: "Hey, I’ve been looking for you."
Rhea (coldly): "Why? So you can add me to your list of things to juggle?"
Kush frowned, taken aback.
Kush: "What are you talking about?"
Rhea: "I saw you with her, Kush. And don’t tell me it’s nothing because it didn’t
look like nothing."
Kush sighed, running a hand through his hair.
Kush: "It’s... complicated."
Rhea: "You keep saying that, but it’s not an explanation. It’s an excuse."
They stood in silence for a moment, the weight of unspoken words hanging
between them.
Kush (softly): "I didn’t mean to hurt you, Rhea. That’s the last thing I’d ever
want to do."
Rhea: "Then stop keeping me in the dark."




Scene 5: A Glimpse of Vulnerability
That night, Rhea sat at her desk, staring at a blank page in her notebook. She
picked up her pen and began to write, her words pouring out like a flood.




125 | P a g e
126


"There’s a difference between longing and loving. One keeps you awake at night,
wondering what could be. The other is a quiet presence, a hand that steadies
you even when the world shakes."
The next day, she found herself at the music room, where Kush was strumming
a guitar, lost in his own thoughts.
Rhea (hesitantly): "Hey."
Kush looked up, his surprise quickly replaced by a smile.
Kush: "Hey. What’s up?"
Rhea: "I wrote something. I thought... maybe you’d like to hear it."
She handed him the notebook, her hands trembling slightly. Kush read in silence,
his expression unreadable.


"You are the pause between breaths,
a calm I didn’t know I craved.
The world spins loud and restless,
but with you, it simply waits.
You are the thread in a tangled weave,
subtle, but holding it all together.
A melody that lingers long after the song,
a quiet reminder of forever.
In your silence, I find my voice,
in your eyes, the courage to be.
You are not a moment, not just a memory—
you are the story within me."


When he finished, he looked up at her, his eyes filled with something Rhea
couldn’t name.
Kush: "It’s beautiful. You’re... amazing, Rhea."
For the first time in days, Rhea felt a flicker of warmth in her chest, a small
ember of hope.



126 | P a g e
127


Scene 6: The Turning Point
The message had been simple, almost cryptic:
"Meet me at the rooftop tonight. Need to talk."
It was from Kush.
Rhea read it twice, her heart skipping an involuntary beat. Was this finally it?
The moment she’d get answers to the questions swirling in her head?
As night fell, the campus grew quieter. The distant hum of laughter and the
occasional bark of a stray dog punctuated the silence as Rhea made her way to
the rooftop. Her steps were steady, but inside, she felt a storm brewing.


The rooftop was dimly lit by a lone bulb, flickering faintly against the cool
breeze. The view of the city skyline was breathtaking, but Rhea barely noticed.
She spotted a figure standing near the edge, back turned to her.
“Kush,” she called softly.
The figure turned around, and Rhea froze. It wasn’t Kush—it was Meera.
Rhea (confused): “What... are you doing here?”
Meera smirked, a hint of something cruel in her eyes.
Meera: “I could ask you the same question, Rhea. But then again, I think I
already know.”
Rhea felt her stomach twist. She glanced around, half-expecting Kush to appear
and explain. But the rooftop was empty except for the two of them.
Rhea: “Where’s Kush? He asked me to meet him here.”
Meera laughed, the sound sharp and cutting.
Meera: “Did he, though? Or did you just assume he meant something by it?”
Rhea’s fists clenched at her sides.
Rhea: “What’s your problem, Meera? Why are you even here?”
Meera stepped closer, her voice dropping to a near-whisper.




127 | P a g e
128


Meera: “Kush and I... we have history. A lot of it. After all, you know na he is
my boyfriend and I know girls like you—always reading too much into things,
thinking you’re special just because someone’s kind to you.”
Rhea took a step back, her mind racing.
Rhea (firmly): “If you’re trying to scare me off, it’s not working. I don’t know
what your deal is with Kush, but that’s between you and him. Leave me out of
it.”
Meera raised an eyebrow, her smirk widening.
Meera: “Oh, Rhea. You’re already in it, whether you like it or not. And trust me,
you don’t want to be.”


At that moment, the sound of hurried footsteps broke the tension. Both women
turned to see Kush stepping onto the rooftop, his face a mix of surprise and
frustration.
Kush (breathless): “What’s going on here?”
Rhea turned to him, her voice trembling.
Rhea: “You tell me, Kush. Why is she here? Why did you ask me to meet you?”
Kush’s eyes darted between the two of them, realization dawning on his face.
Kush (angrily to Meera): “You sent the message, didn’t you?”
Meera shrugged, unbothered.
Meera: “Guilty. Someone had to clear the air.”
Kush (exasperated): “What are you doing, Meera? This isn’t your fight.”
Meera: “It’s not a fight, Kush. It’s a warning. She needs to know where she
stands.”
Rhea (interrupting): “Enough! Both of you. I’m not some pawn in whatever this
is. If you have something to say to me, Kush, say it now.”
Kush took a deep breath, his gaze locking with Rhea’s.
Kush: “Rhea, I... I never meant for you to get dragged into this. Meera and I...
it’s complicated.”


128 | P a g e
129


Rhea (bitterly): “You’re good at that word, aren’t you? ‘Complicated.’ It’s your
answer to everything.”
Kush stepped closer, his voice soft but urgent.
Kush: “Please, just listen to me. I care about you, Rhea. More than you know.
But there are things in my life—things I can’t just ignore.”
Rhea: “Like her?”
Kush didn’t answer immediately, and the silence was deafening.
Rhea (sobbing): Oh, stop it, Kush. Meera is right, I...I should know where I
stand. After all, you guys have been together so well and fine for years.




Scene 7: Aftermath
Rhea didn’t wait for him to explain. The weight of his silence was louder than
any words he could have said. She turned sharply and walked away, her steps
quick and purposeful, her head held high even though her vision blurred with
unshed tears. The air felt heavy, pressing against her chest with every hurried
step. Kush called after her, his voice laced with desperation, but she didn’t stop.
She couldn’t.
The stairwell echoed with the sharp click of her sandals against the concrete,
each sounds a drumbeat to her swirling thoughts. Why didn’t he say anything?
Why couldn’t he just deny it? Her fingers clenched into fists as she reached the
bottom of the stairs, her breathing uneven. The campus lights blurred through
her tear-filled eyes, the world around her turning into a haze of colors and
shadows.
By the time she reached her room, her composure was hanging by a thread. She
fumbled with the key, her hands shaking as she tried to unlock the door. When it
finally gave way, she pushed it open and stepped inside, closing it behind her
with a definitive click. The silence of her room felt suffocating, amplifying the
storm within her.
Rhea dropped her bag onto the chair and sat on the edge of her bed, staring at
the notebook on her desk. It lay there, pristine and untouched, as if mocking her.
Writing had always been her escape, her solace in moments like these, but now

129 | P a g e
130


the words wouldn’t come. Her hand hovered over the notebook for a long
moment before she finally picked it up, flipping it open to a blank page.
Her pen trembled as she held it, the ink pooling slightly at the tip. She pressed it
to the paper, but no words formed. Instead, a single tear fell onto the page,
smudging the ink into a messy blot. Frustrated, she threw the pen onto the desk
and buried her face in her hands.
The room felt too small, too quiet, too still. She stood abruptly, pacing back and
forth, her thoughts a tangled mess. Was Meera right? Was I just fooling myself
into thinking there was something different about him? Something honest? She
shook her head, trying to push the doubts away, but they clung to her like a
second skin.
Rhea walked to the window and pulled it open, letting the cool night air wash
over her. The faint sounds of laughter and music from the cultural fest drifted in
a stark contrast to the turmoil inside her. She leaned against the window frame,
staring out into the darkness. Somewhere out there, Kush was still at the fest,
probably with Meera. The thought made her stomach twist painfully.
She turned back to the desk, her gaze falling once again on the notebook. This
time, she picked up the pen with a little more determination. If words wouldn’t
come, she’d force them out. Slowly, hesitantly, she began to write:
"Sometimes, the truth isn’t loud.
It doesn’t scream or shout.
It lingers in the spaces between—
in the silence of things unsaid,
in the pauses where hearts falter."
She paused, her hand shaking. The words felt hollow, like an echo of something
she couldn’t quite grasp. She set the pen down and closed the notebook, pushing
it away as if it burned her. For the first time in years, writing didn’t help. It
didn’t soothe the ache in her chest or quiet the questions in her mind.
Rhea curled up on her bed, clutching a pillow to her chest. The weight of the
day pressed down on her, and the tears she had been holding back finally spilled
over. They came silently, soaking into the fabric of the pillow as her shoulders
shook. She didn’t cry out of anger or sadness—she cried because she felt lost.
Lost in her feelings, in her doubts, in her own mind.



130 | P a g e
131


The night stretched on, the sounds of the fest fading into the distance. And as
Rhea lay there in the dim light of her room, the only sound was the faint hum of
the ceiling fan and her own uneven breathing.

                 Chapter 21: Pieces of Truth


The air was thick with unspoken words as Rhea sat alone in her room, the faint
hum of campus life seeping through the window. Outside, laughter echoed—
carefree, distant, and painfully contrasting with the chaos in her mind.


Scene 1: The Morning After
Rhea avoided her reflection in the mirror, choosing instead to focus on the
mundane—brushing her hair, folding the pile of clothes on her bed. Anything to
distract her from the memory of last night.
Her phone buzzed. A message from her friend, Ananya:
"Brunch at 11. Don’t flake out, loser."
Rhea sighed. Ananya had a knack for dragging her out of her self-imposed
isolation. She needed this, even if it meant pretending to be okay.


At the café, the usual group had gathered: Ananya, playful and loud; Arjun,
cracking jokes that sometimes landed; Priya including Nina, the silent observer
who always seemed to know more than she let on.
Ananya (grinning): “Rhea, you look like you haven’t slept in days. Late-night
Netflix binge or existential crisis?”
The group laughed, but Priya caught Rhea’s uneasy smile.
Priya (softly): “You okay?”
Rhea hesitated before nodding.
Rhea (forcing a laugh): “Just a lot on my mind. Nothing dramatic, I promise.”
But her voice lacked conviction, and Nina noticed.




132 | P a g e
133


Scene 2: The Library Encounter
Later that afternoon, Rhea found herself at the library. Books had always been
her sanctuary, their familiar smell and comforting silence offering solace.
She reached for a novel on the top shelf when a familiar voice startled her.
Kush: “Need help?”
Rhea turned sharply, her heart skipping a beat. Kush stood there, hands in his
pockets, his expression unreadable.
Rhea (coldly): “What are you doing here?”
Kush: “I wanted to talk. About last night.”
Rhea (sarcastic): “Let me guess—‘it’s complicated,’ right?”
Kush winced, but his tone remained steady.
Kush: “I deserve that. But can you at least let me explain?”
Rhea crossed her arms, her gaze challenging.
Rhea: “Fine. You’ve got two minutes.”
Kush took a deep breath.
Kush: “Meera and I... we’ve known each other for years. We had something
once, but it’s not what it looks like now. She’s dealing with her own issues, and
I’ve been trying to help her. But I didn’t mean for it to affect us—our
friendship.”
Rhea’s eyes narrowed.
Rhea: “Friendship? Is that what you think this is?”
Kush stepped closer, his voice low.
Kush: “Rhea, you mean more to me than I can put into words. But I’m trying to
figure out how to handle everything without hurting anyone.”
Rhea’s defenses wavered for a moment, but the memory of Meera’s smirk
brought her resolve back.
Rhea: “Maybe you should figure that out first, Kush. Then we can talk.”
She walked away, leaving Kush standing amidst the rows of books, frustration
etched on his face.
133 | P a g e
134


Scene 3: A Late-Night Call
That night, Rhea lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Her phone buzzed—a call
from Ananya.
Aanya (excitedly): “Rhea! Guess what? Arjun’s planning a road trip for the
group next weekend. You in?”
Rhea hesitated. A road trip meant hours of forced cheerfulness and pretending
nothing was wrong.
Rhea: “I don’t know, Ananya. I’ve got a lot of work—”
Ananya (cutting her off): “Nope. No excuses. You’re coming, and that’s final.”
Rhea smiled despite herself. Ananya’s relentless optimism was hard to resist.




Scene 4: Nina’s Advice
The next day, Nina found Rhea in the campus garden, lost in thought.
Nina: “Want to talk about it?”
Rhea sighed.
Rhea: “It’s just... Kush. He’s so... frustrating. One moment, he’s kind and
thoughtful, and the next, he’s tangled in his own mess.”
Nina nodded, her expression calm.
Nina: “People are complicated, Rhea. But the question is—do you think he’s
worth the frustration?”
Rhea didn’t answer immediately.
Rhea: “I don’t know. Maybe. But how do I deal with someone who can’t even
figure out what he wants?”
Nina smiled faintly.
Nina: “Sometimes, it’s not about them figuring it out. It’s about you deciding if
you’re willing to wait while they do.”

134 | P a g e
135


Scene 5: The Road Trip Announcement
The campus café was alive with chatter, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and
laughter filling the air. Arjun stood on a wobbly chair in the middle of the room,
clapping his hands for attention. The crowd hushed in anticipation, their faces
glowing with excitement.
Arjun (grinning): “Ladies and gentlemen, pack your bags! This weekend, we’re
hitting the road! Destination? The hills. Think bonfires, late-night stories, and
absolutely zero Wi-Fi!”
The announcement was met with cheers and whistles. Students clapped and
hollered, already planning their playlists and outfit choices. Rhea, seated at a
corner table with Ananya, Priya, and Nina, couldn’t help but smile at the
infectious energy.
Ananya (nudging Rhea): “See? I told you he was up to something fun. This is
going to be epic. You’ll thank me later.”
Rhea (teasing): “Epic, huh? Are you saying you’ll actually survive without your
five-step skincare routine for two whole days?”
Ananya (mock-offended): “How dare you? I’ll have you know, I’ve already
packed travel-sized bottles!”
The group laughed, their voices mingling with the happy chaos around them.
Across the room, Rhea noticed Kush standing with a few friends, his posture
relaxed but his gaze fixed on her. When their eyes met, he gave her a small,
tentative smile, one that carried both apology and hope.
Before she could dwell on it, Meera’s voice cut through the chatter.
Meera (coolly): “This road trip sounds fun, but I’ll have to skip. Too much work
piling up.”
She was standing with her arms crossed, her expression unreadable. Her gaze
flickered toward Rhea for just a second—sharp, pointed—before she looked
away.
Nina (whispering to Priya): “Classic Meera. She’s not coming, but she’ll make
sure everyone knows she’s too busy to bother.”
Priya (chuckling softly): “It’s not a party unless Meera turns it into a drama.”


135 | P a g e
136


Rhea stayed silent, pretending not to notice the tension. But she couldn’t ignore
the way Meera’s words had lingered, the way her glance had felt like a
challenge.
Ananya (leaning in): “Ignore her, Rhea. She just loves being the center of
attention.”
Rhea (shrugging): “I’m not thinking about her.”
But that wasn’t entirely true. A part of her couldn’t shake the nagging feeling
that Meera’s words were more than just a casual comment.
Nina (brightly, breaking the mood): “Okay, let’s focus on the important stuff!
Who’s riding with who? I call shotgun in Arjun’s car!”
Ananya (grinning): “You just want to DJ. Fine, but Rhea and I are sticking
together. We’re road trip buddies.”
Priya (laughing): “You two can fight over playlists. I’m bringing snacks!”
Their conversation carried on, light and cheerful, but Rhea found her thoughts
wandering. She glanced at Kush again, catching him mid-laugh as he talked to
his friends. For a brief moment, she felt a flicker of something resembling
hope—a small, fragile feeling she couldn’t quite name.
Maybe, just maybe, this road trip would be exactly what she needed.




136 | P a g e

                Chapter 22: The Road Ahead


The sun hung low in the sky, casting an amber glow across the open highway.
The group’s van hummed along the winding roads, the wind whipping through
open windows. Inside, the chatter was endless—laughter, music, and the
occasional squabble about playlists. But beneath the lighthearted banter, Rhea
sat quietly, her thoughts still preoccupied with the events of the past few days.


Scene 1: The Journey Begins
Rhea leaned her head against the window, watching the countryside pass by in a
blur. Ananya was in the front seat, talking animatedly with Arjun, while Priya
scrolling her phone and Nina reading a book sitting beside Rhea. Rhea felt the
pull of something larger than her worries—the promise of adventure, of escape
from the complications of her mind.
Rhea (to herself, softly): "Maybe this is what I need. A break. Just a few days
away from everything."
She closed her eyes for a moment, but a faint memory of Kush’s face flickered
in her mind. She quickly pushed it away. There was no room for him on this trip,
not yet. She wasn’t ready.




Scene 2: Pit Stop
A few hours into the journey, they made a quick stop at a roadside diner. The
group poured out of the van, stretching their legs and heading inside for a quick
snack. The air was warm, and the smell of fresh coffee filled the air. As Rhea
walked in, she spotted Kush standing at the counter, ordering coffee.
Rhea (surprised, walking up to him): "What are you doing here?"
Kush turned, a smile breaking through his usual seriousness.



137 | P a g e
138


Kush (grinning): "Same as you. Road trip. Though, I didn’t expect to see you
here."
Rhea’s heart skipped a beat, but she quickly masked it with a cool exterior.
Rhea (shrugging): "Yeah, well, I’m here with my friends. What about you?"
Kush: "Same. I’m with a few people from my class. Just getting away for the
weekend."
There was a pause, a tension that neither of them fully acknowledged.
Rhea (glancing away): "Well, have fun."
She turned to join her friends, but as she did, she felt a tug at her sleeve.
Kush (softly): "Rhea, I didn’t mean to make things weird between us."
Rhea didn’t respond immediately. She just nodded, not trusting herself to say
anything else, before walking away.




Scene 3: The Campfire
By nightfall, the group had set up camp near a secluded lake, the stars scattered
above like diamonds in the sky. A fire crackled at the center of their campsite,
casting a warm glow across their faces. Rhea sat near the edge, wrapped in a
blanket, watching the flames dance in the breeze.
Arjun was strumming a guitar, his voice joining in on the melodies. Ananya,
Priya and Nina were engaged in an animated conversation, and though Rhea
tried to lose herself in the warmth of the fire, she couldn’t shake the feeling of
being watched.
She turned slightly and saw Kush, standing at the edge of the group, looking
toward her. For a moment, their eyes met across the fire, and something passed
between them—a silent understanding, a shared longing.
Ananya (teasing): "Rhea, you’ve been awfully quiet tonight. What’s going on in
that brain of yours?"
Rhea forced a smile and shook her head.
Rhea: "Just enjoying the fire. Nothing more."

138 | P a g e
139


Scene 4: A Walk by the Lake
Later, after most of the group had settled into their tents, Rhea slipped away to
the lake. The water was still, reflecting the stars above, and she welcomed the
solitude. She sat on a rock at the water’s edge, her thoughts swirling.
Suddenly, she heard footsteps behind her. She turned, expecting to see one of
her friends, but instead, it was Kush.
Rhea (surprised): "Kush? What are you doing here?"
He sat beside her, a few inches apart but close enough that she could feel his
presence.
Kush (softly): "I needed to get away too."
There was a long pause as they both stared at the water. Rhea couldn’t ignore
the ache in her chest—the one that had been there ever since their last
conversation.
Rhea: "Why did you come here, Kush? After everything... everything that’s
happened, why did you follow me?"
Kush shifted, his gaze distant as he spoke.
Kush (quietly): "I didn’t come to chase you, Rhea. I came because... because I
wanted to figure out what’s going on. Between us. Because I don’t want to keep
pretending that there’s nothing there. I can’t ignore this connection."
Rhea’s heart raced, but she didn’t allow herself to acknowledge it. Instead, she
forced herself to stay composed.
Rhea (sternly): "It’s complicated, Kush. And right now, I don’t want to
complicate things more."
Kush: "You think I don’t know that? I know this isn’t easy. But I also know that
if I don’t try now, I might regret it forever."
Rhea didn’t know how to respond. She was caught between the weight of her
own desires and the reality of the situation.
Rhea (shaking her head): "I don’t know what you want from me, Kush. I don’t
even know what I want anymore."
Kush (leaning in slightly): "I’m not asking for anything right now. I’m just...
I’m just telling you how I feel."
139 | P a g e
140


The air between them was thick with unspoken words. Rhea could feel the pull,
the magnetic force between them, but she wasn’t ready to let it in. Not yet.




Scene 5: The Next Morning
The first light of dawn painted the campsite in soft shades of gold and pink. The
air was crisp and quiet, save for the occasional rustle of leaves and the distant
chirping of birds. The lake shimmered under the early sun, a glassy mirror
reflecting the towering trees that surrounded it.
Rhea stood by the edge of the water, hugging her arms against the slight chill.
The quiet solitude of the morning gave her space to think, but her thoughts were
anything but calm. She hadn’t slept much, her mind racing with the events of
the previous day, with the unspoken words that seemed to hang heavy in the air
between her and Kush.
Behind her, the campsite was slowly coming to life. Ananya was struggling to
fold her sleeping bag, grumbling under her breath about its apparent grudge
against her. Arjun was loudly arguing with Nina over whose playlist had been
the most “road trip appropriate.” Laughter and chatter filled the space, a stark
contrast to the stillness Rhea felt inside.
Kush emerged from his tent, his hair tousled and his expression soft with sleep.
He carried two cups of coffee and approached Rhea cautiously, as though
unsure if she wanted his company.
Kush (quietly): “Morning. Thought you could use this.”
Rhea glanced at the cup he offered and hesitated for a moment before taking it.
Rhea (softly): “Thanks.”
They stood side by side in silence, watching the lake. The moments stretched
out, the quiet between them filled with the weight of things unsaid.
Kush: “Didn’t sleep much, huh?”
Rhea (shaking her head): “You could tell?”
Kush (smiling faintly): “I can always tell. You overthink everything.”
Rhea let out a small laugh, more of a breath than a sound.
140 | P a g e
141


Rhea: “Maybe. Or maybe some things just don’t make sense, no matter how
much you think about them.”
Kush looked at her then, his gaze steady and searching.
Kush: “Some things aren’t meant to make sense. They’re just... meant to be
felt.”
Rhea turned to him, startled by the quiet intensity in his voice. For a moment,
the world seemed to narrow down to just the two of them, the lake and the
rising sun a mere backdrop to the tension that crackled in the air.
Before either could say more, Ananya’s voice broke the moment.
Ananya (calling out): “Rhea! Stop brooding and help me with this stupid bag!”
Rhea stepped back, breaking the connection, and turned toward the campsite.
Rhea: “Coming!”
As the group loaded their bags into the van and prepared to leave, Rhea felt the
subtle shift in the air. It wasn’t just the cool morning mist that clung to the
trees—it was the realization that something between her and Kush had changed.
It was unspoken, undefined, but it was there, a quiet hum in the spaces between
them.
She climbed into the van and took her seat by the window, her coffee cup still
warm in her hands. Outside, Kush was helping Priya load the last of the bags,
laughing at one of her jokes. His smile was easy, but when his eyes met Rhea’s
through the window, it softened into something else—something just for her.
As the van pulled out of the campsite and onto the winding road, Rhea stared
out at the passing trees, her thoughts far away. She had tried to resist, to push
away the feelings, but the truth was undeniable: something was happening
between them.
And for the first time in a long time, Rhea didn’t know how to stop it—or if she
even wanted to.




141 | P a g e
142


Scene 6: Back to reality
When the group returned to campus, the hum of everyday life swallowed the
lingering tranquility of the weekend. The campus bustled with energy—students
rushing to classes, friends laughing over chai at the canteen, and clubs preparing
for upcoming events. The familiar chaos seemed to reassert itself as if to remind
everyone that the trip was a mere detour, a momentary escape.
But for Rhea, the noise only made her more restless. The memories of the trip
played in her mind like a song stuck on repeat. She thought of the quiet
conversations, the stolen glances, and the feeling that something intangible had
shifted between her and Kush.
In her room, she dropped her duffle bag by the door and sank onto her bed. Her
room felt oddly foreign, as if she were seeing it for the first time. The comfort
of her books, her familiar desk, and the string lights that framed the window did
little to ground her. She leaned back, staring at the ceiling, but even that felt like
too much.
The knot in her chest grew tighter. She had thought the chaos of campus life
would drown out the pull of her thoughts, but instead, it amplified them. She
couldn’t stop replaying the trip in her head. The way Kush had looked at her by
the lake, the quiet intensity in his voice when he spoke to her, the way he had
lingered near her when he didn’t have to.
Her phone buzzed on the table, pulling her from her thoughts. She reached for it,
half expecting it to be a group chat filled with post-trip jokes and photos. But it
wasn’t.
It was from Kush.
The message was simple, yet it sent her heart into overdrive.
Kush (text): “Can we talk?”
She stared at the screen, her thumb hovering over the keyboard. Her mind raced
with questions. What does he want to talk about? Was it about the trip? About
us?
For a moment, she debated ignoring it. She could pretend she was busy, pretend
she hadn’t seen it. But deep down, she knew she wouldn’t.



142 | P a g e
143



         Chapter 23: Confronting the Unspoken


The campus buzzed with its usual activity. Students rushing between classes,
professors walking briskly to meetings, the familiar hum of a busy university.
Yet for Rhea, it all felt muted. Her thoughts were occupied with one thing—
Kush. The text from him had lingered in her mind all night, her phone screen lit
up with his words.
“Can we talk?”
She hadn't responded immediately. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to. It was more
that she wasn’t ready. She wasn't ready to face what had been growing between
them, what she had been pretending to ignore. But now, as the morning
unfolded, it felt inevitable.




Scene 1: The Encounter
Rhea had just finished a lecture and was heading to the library when she saw
him. Kush was standing near the entrance, his hands in his pockets, his gaze
distant as he looked out over the campus quad. He was waiting for her.
Her heart skipped a beat, but she forced herself to stay calm. She had to
confront this. She couldn’t run anymore.
She approached him slowly, her footsteps almost muffled by the soft hum of
campus life around them. When he saw her, his face softened slightly, but there
was a tension in his posture.
Rhea (tentatively): "You wanted to talk?"
Kush (nodding): "Yeah. I’ve been thinking about what happened the other day,
at the lake. About everything."
Rhea: "And?"
Kush (after a long pause): "I think we need to stop pretending that there’s
nothing between us. I feel it, Rhea. I know you feel it too."


143 | P a g e
144


Rhea opened her mouth to protest, but the words faltered on her lips. She
couldn’t deny the truth in his words. The connection was undeniable. But she
wasn’t ready to dive into it—not yet.
Rhea (shaking her head): "Kush, this isn’t something we can just... talk about
and make it go away. It’s complicated."
Kush (quietly): "I know it is. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. I can’t keep
pretending like I don’t care about you. And I know you’re scared. I can see it in
your eyes."
Rhea (defensively): "You don’t know anything about what’s in my eyes."
But despite the sharpness in her words, Rhea couldn’t help but feel her defenses
crumbling. She didn’t want to be vulnerable. She didn’t want to let anyone in,
especially not him. Not like this.
Kush (softly): "I’m not asking for anything right now, Rhea. I just... I just need
you to be honest with me. And with yourself."
There was a moment of silence, a pause where the world seemed to stop. Rhea
could feel the weight of his words, the sincerity in his voice, but she wasn’t sure
if she was ready to accept it.
Rhea: “Kush, you... you have Meera.”
His jaw tightened, and he looked away, guilt and frustration flashing across his
face.
Kush: “I know. And that’s why this is so damn complicated. But Rhea, when
I’m around you... everything else fades. It’s like—”
Rhea (cutting him off): “Stop.”
Her voice was firm, though it trembled slightly. She stepped back, putting space
between them.
Rhea: “You don’t get to say things like that, Kush. Not when things are the way
they are.”
His face fell, and for a moment, neither of them spoke. The rooftop seemed to
close in around them, the quiet more deafening than any words.
Finally, Rhea shook her head, tears stinging her eyes.



144 | P a g e
145


Rhea: “I can’t be a part of this. Whatever this is, it’s not fair. Not to Meera, not
to me, and not even to you.”
Without waiting for his reply, she turned and walked away, her steps quick and
purposeful. Her heart ached with every step, but she didn’t look back. She
couldn’t.
Back in her room, she sank onto her bed, her mind racing. She reached for her
journal, hoping to pour her emotions onto the page, but for the first time in
years, the words wouldn’t come




Scene 2: The Decision
Rhea walked away from Kush that day, her mind in turmoil. She couldn’t stop
thinking about what he had said. What was she supposed to do with that? She
wasn’t ready for love, or even for the possibility of it. But the pull was there,
undeniable. She knew she couldn’t ignore it forever.
Later that evening, as she sat alone in her room and when she couldn’t write
what she felt, she stared at the message on her phone. Kush’s words still
lingered in the air, in her thoughts. She could feel the weight of them pressing
on her chest.
Rhea (to herself): "Why is this so hard?"
She ran her fingers through her hair, frustrated with herself. She wasn’t
someone who needed validation. She didn’t need anyone to fill the emptiness
she had always carried with her. But for some reason, Kush felt different. He
made her question everything.
Just as she was about to put her phone down, her screen lit up with another
message from him.
Kush (text): “I’m here when you’re ready to talk. Just know that I’m not going
anywhere.”
Her finger hovered over the keyboard, her mind racing. Was she ready? Could
she let go of the walls she had built up around herself for so long?

Scene 3: A Heartfelt Conversation
The next day, Rhea met Kush —the campus quad, where the sun was low,
casting long shadows across the stone walkways. The air had a crispness to it,
but neither of them seemed to care about the chill.
Rhea (quietly): "You were right, you know. About everything."
Kush turned toward her, his expression unreadable.
Kush: "About what?"
Rhea (taking a deep breath): "About what I feel. About this... connection. I don’t
know what it is or why it’s there, but it’s real. And I can’t keep denying it."
Kush’s face softened, his eyes lighting up slightly, though he remained calm.
Rhea (her voice trembling): "But, Kush, you have Meera. And she’s... she’s my
friend. I see how much she cares about you, and I can’t be the reason that breaks.
It wouldn’t be fair to her."
Kush (taking a step closer): "Meera and I... we’re not what you think we are.
Things between us have been—"
Rhea (shaking her head): "No, Kush, don’t. Don’t say things you can’t take back.
It doesn’t matter how complicated it is between you two. What matters is that
she’s there, and she believes in... whatever you have together. I can’t be the
person who takes that away."
Kush (his voice breaking slightly): "Rhea, it’s not about taking anything away.
It’s about being honest. About what’s here between us."
Rhea (her voice firm but pained): "And what’s here won’t work. Not like this.
Not with everything that’s already in the way. We’d only hurt each other, Kush.
And that’s not the kind of connection I want."
Kush (desperately): "What if it could work? What if we tried?"
Rhea (a tear slipping down her cheek): "And what if it doesn’t? What if we ruin
everything—your relationship, our friendship, even who we are right now?"
Kush opened his mouth to respond but stopped, his shoulders sagging as the
weight of her words settled in.
Rhea (her voice softer now): "I care about you, Kush. I really do. But some
lines... they’re better left uncrossed."
146 | P a g e
147


For a long moment, neither of them spoke. The tension hung thick in the air, the
unspoken feelings, the regrets, all crowding the space between them.
Finally, Rhea took a shaky step back, her voice barely a whisper.
Rhea: "I need to go."
Kush didn’t stop her this time, his hand falling to his side as he watched her
walk away, her figure retreating into the night like a shadow carrying the weight
of unsaid truths.




Scene 4: The Quiet Aftermath
The days that followed were heavy. Rhea kept herself busy, trying to outrun the
constant weight of that conversation. The campus felt colder, more distant
somehow as if the world around her had shifted into something unfamiliar. She
threw herself into her studies, into her routine, hoping that by filling her time,
she could fill the emptiness that had settled in her chest.
But no matter how hard she tried to distract herself, the memory of the
conversation with Kush lingered, an ache she couldn’t escape. Thoughts echoed
in her mind: What if it could work? She’d asked herself the same question a
thousand times. What if? What if she hadn’t walked away? What if they had
tried?
Yet, every time she thought of him, her heart twisted with the knowledge that
some decisions weren’t meant to be undone. And she couldn’t shake the image
of Meera’s face—how could she be the one to break it all?
It was early evening when Rhea found herself walking across the campus, the
sun casting long shadows that stretched like thin threads into the cool air. She
was headed to the library, though she wasn’t sure why. She just needed to be
somewhere that felt familiar, where the noise of her thoughts couldn’t reach her.
She reached the front steps of the library and froze. There, sitting on the stone
bench, was Kush. He was leaning back with his arms crossed, staring ahead, his
face unreadable. Rhea’s heart skipped a beat. She should have turned around,
and walked the other way. But something in her feet refused to move.



147 | P a g e
148


Kush hadn’t seen her yet. She debated walking away, but her feet were rooted to
the ground, unwilling to take another step. He glanced up just then, and for a
moment, their eyes locked, the quiet intensity between them palpable even
across the distance. Neither of them said anything. There was no need for words.
Slowly, Kush stood up, his posture tense, but he didn’t approach her. Instead, he
stayed where he was, waiting. Rhea took a tentative step forward, her mind
racing. What was he thinking? What was he doing here?
Kush (quietly, his voice laced with uncertainty): "Rhea..."
Her name was like a breath on the wind, fragile and lingering. She swallowed
hard, gathering her courage before responding.
Rhea: "I didn’t think I’d see you here."
Kush didn’t smile. There was no reassurance in his gaze, just an unspoken
understanding of the space that had formed between them.
Kush: "I wanted to talk. I know... I know I shouldn’t have asked you to stay. Not
after everything. But I can’t stop thinking about it. About what you said."
Rhea’s heart pounded in her chest, but she steadied herself. She couldn’t let this
conversation turn into another round of “what-ifs.” She couldn’t go down that
road again.
Rhea (gently, but firmly): "Kush, we’ve already talked. I told you how I feel."
Kush stepped closer, his voice low, almost pleading.
Kush: "But you didn’t say everything. You didn’t say what’s still between us.
You didn’t say what’s real. I can’t stop thinking about you, Rhea. And I know—
I know—it’s complicated. But I’m not ready to let it go. Not yet."
Rhea took a deep breath, her emotions warring inside her. She looked at him,
really looked at him. The boy who had been a part of her life in so many small
ways. The boy who had somehow become everything and nothing at the same
time. He was there, standing in front of her, his eyes filled with a silent
promise—one she wasn’t sure she could keep.
Rhea (softly): "Kush, I care about you. You have to know that. But I can’t do
this. I can’t live in the ‘maybe.’ It’s not fair to anyone. Not to you, not to Meera.
Not to me. We have to let this go."


148 | P a g e
149


Kush stood still, his expression hardening, but there was a vulnerability in his
eyes that made Rhea’s heart break. He opened his mouth to say something, but
the words never came. He just sighed, long and slow, as though the air had been
knocked from his lungs.
Kush: "I don’t know if I can let you go, Rhea."
The words hung in the air, thick with unspoken emotion. Rhea’s chest tightened,
and she found herself fighting against the tears that threatened to rise. She
wanted to say something. She wanted to tell him that she felt the same, that she
didn’t want to let him go either. But she knew she couldn’t. Not like this. Not
when it would only hurt everyone in the end.
Rhea (barely above a whisper): "You have to, Kush. We both do."
For a long moment, neither of them spoke. It felt as if the entire world had
paused, waiting for the decision to be made. Rhea couldn’t meet his eyes
anymore. She stared down at the ground, her heart heavy, her thoughts racing.
Finally, Kush took a step back, his face closing off, the warmth in his gaze
disappearing. He turned slightly, as though preparing to leave.
Kush: "I’ll… I’ll see you around, Rhea."
And with that, he walked away, his footsteps growing fainter with every step.
Rhea didn’t move, didn’t even breathe. She just stood there, feeling the weight
of the silence that had settled in his absence. The decision was made. But it
didn’t make anything easier.
She closed her eyes, letting the cool air wash over her, and for the first time in
days, Rhea allowed herself to feel the ache in her chest, the sadness of knowing
that sometimes, the hardest decisions were the ones that felt right.

                Chapter 24: One Step at a Time


Scene 1: A New Beginning
The evening had come quickly, and the campus was bathed in the soft glow of
streetlights. Rhea sat in her room, her notebook open in front of her, but the
words weren’t coming. She couldn’t focus. The memory of her last words
echoed in her mind: We both do. They hadn’t spoken since that night, but she
hadn’t stopped thinking about him.
The more she thought, the more the weight of the situation pressed on her chest.
She couldn’t keep running from it. She cared about him, deeply. But it wasn’t
just about what she felt anymore—it was about what they could become, if they
were brave enough to face it together.
Rhea looked at her phone, the screen blank. Her fingers hovered above the
keyboard. She had tried to avoid texting him for days, fearing that any message
would undo everything. But there it was again—his voice in her head, his words
still lingering. What if we tried?
Taking a deep breath, she began to type:
Rhea (texting):
"Kush… I’ve been thinking. About everything we talked about. And I know
things have been complicated, and I know there are a lot of reasons we
shouldn’t. But I can’t keep pretending like there’s nothing between us. I think we
deserve a chance to figure it out, together. Maybe we can work through the mess
if we’re both willing to try."
She stared at the message, her heart racing. She had never been good at this—at
putting her feelings into words. Especially when those feelings were tangled up
in so much uncertainty.
Rhea looked at the text again, then at the phone, her finger hovering over the
send button. She hesitated for a long moment, wondering if she was making the
right choice. Was she ready to let herself feel again, to let someone else in?
Finally, she exhaled, pressing send. The moment it was gone, she felt a mix of
relief and fear. What would he say? Would he even want the same thing?

150 | P a g e
151


Minutes passed, each one feeling like an eternity. Rhea leaned back in her chair,
her eyes fixed on the screen, but the reply didn’t come. She could feel the
tension in the air, thick and still.
Just as she was about to give up and let the moment fade, her phone buzzed.
Kush (texting):
"Rhea, I’ve been thinking too. Maybe I was too quick to back away. I can’t
promise it’ll be easy, but I’m willing to try. Let’s take it one step at a time."
Rhea’s heart skipped. A rush of warmth flooded her chest. She read the message
again, a smile tugging at her lips despite herself. It wasn’t perfect. It wasn’t a
guarantee. But it was something. It was the beginning of something new.
With a deep breath, she typed back:
Rhea (texting):
"One step at a time sounds perfect."
And for the first time in a long while, Rhea allowed herself to hope.




Scene 5: Looking Ahead
Weeks passed, and Rhea found herself looking forward to the quiet moments
with Kush. There was still a lot of uncertainty in her heart, but there was also a
sense of peace that she hadn’t felt in a long time.
As the semester drew to a close, they sat together on a bench overlooking the
campus, the sky painted in shades of pink and orange as the sun set.
Kush (smiling): "You know, I’ve been thinking about something."
Rhea (raising an eyebrow): "What?"
Kush (grinning): "You’re going to hate me for this, but I think we should take a
trip. A real one. Just the two of us."
Rhea laughed, the sound light and free, something she hadn’t heard in a while.
Rhea (teasing): "A trip? You sure you’re not trying to run away from
something?"
Kush (with a wink): "Maybe. But I think it’ll be good for us. What do you say?"

151 | P a g e
152


Rhea looked at him, the uncertainty still there but no longer as overwhelming.
She smiled back.
Rhea: "Maybe it’s time for a new adventure."




152 | P a g e

            Chapter 25: Embracing the Moment


Scene 1: Quiet Reflections
The weeks that followed Rhea’s tentative decision to give Kush a chance were
both thrilling and unsettling. As the semester neared its end, the campus
transformed into a flurry of final exams and farewell gatherings. Yet, for Rhea,
everything felt quieter now, as if she was living in a slower, more deliberate
world. Her thoughts were often interrupted by the soft murmur of Kush’s voice
or the unexpected warmth of his smile.
One evening, she sat by her room window, staring out at the darkened campus.
The streetlights flickered, casting shadows across the cobblestone pathways. It
had been a long day of study sessions, but instead of feeling the usual stress of
finals, Rhea found herself thinking about him again.
Rhea (softly to herself): "I didn’t expect this… not in a million years."
Her phone buzzed on the table beside her. She glanced at it, the screen lighting
up with a new message from Kush.
Kush (text): “You up? Wanna grab a coffee before the madness starts?”
Rhea smiled softly. She had a million things to do, but there was something
about the invitation—casual, yet meaningful—that made her want to put
everything on hold.
Rhea (text): “On my way.”




Scene 2: A Simple Coffee Date
The local café near the campus had become their place. The corner table by the
window, always bathed in warm light, was where they had shared countless
conversations. It was where they talked about everything—from their childhood
memories to their deepest fears, the things that made them laugh, and the things



153 | P a g e
154


that made them ache. And tonight, it felt more important than ever to keep the
routine.
Rhea walked into the café and found him already seated, a steaming cup of
coffee in front of him. He looked up as she entered, and his face lit up with the
kind of warmth that made Rhea’s heart skip a beat.
Kush (grinning): "There you are. I was starting to think I’d be drinking this all
alone."
Rhea rolled her eyes playfully as she slid into the seat across from him.
Rhea: "You wish."
They sat there in comfortable silence for a moment, the quiet hum of the café in
the background, the sounds of espresso machines and soft music filling the air.
Kush (finally speaking, voice softer): "I’ve been thinking about you a lot lately."
Rhea (frowning slightly): "What about me?"
Kush (looking her in the eye): "About us. And how… easy it feels to be with
you. Like we’ve always known each other. Even though we haven’t."
There was something in his voice that made Rhea pause. She had always prided
herself on her independence, on keeping people at arm's length. But Kush had a
way of breaking through those walls without her even realizing it.
Rhea (quietly): "I think about you too."
The confession was simple, but it carried a weight that neither of them had
expected. A soft tension filled the air between them as their gazes locked, and
for a brief moment, time seemed to stop. Rhea was acutely aware of the way her
heart beat a little faster whenever Kush was near, the way his presence made
everything else fade into the background.
But even as she let herself acknowledge these feelings, she couldn't shake the
fear that always lingered just beneath the surface. She wanted this, wanted him,
but was she ready?
Rhea (hesitantly): "What about Meera? How is she doing?"
Kush (sighing, looking away briefly): "She’s... distant. She doesn’t talk much or
share anything anymore. She’s always busy with her own world."
Rhea (softly): "And that’s why you found space for... this? For us?"

154 | P a g e
155


Kush (meeting her eyes): "I didn’t mean for it to happen, Rhea. It’s just... with
Meera, it felt like I was always on the outside. But with you, it’s different. You
make it easy to be myself. To feel... understood."
Rhea looked away, her heart heavy with a mix of emotions she couldn’t quite
name.
Kush (with a hint of teasing): "You know, you’ve got this look on your face.
Like you’re about to say something profound."
Rhea laughed, grateful for the lightness he brought into the moment.
Rhea: "Maybe I am."
They shared a quiet laugh, and for a moment, everything seemed right in the
world. But Rhea knew the storm was coming. She couldn’t keep running from
what was happening between them.




Scene 3: The Storm
Days passed, and Rhea began to feel the pressure of finals closing in. But it
wasn’t just the academic stress that weighed heavily on her mind—it was Kush.
The deeper she allowed herself to go, the more complicated things seemed to
become. Her thoughts would often drift to him in class, during study sessions,
and even in the quiet moments before sleep.
And then, there was the nagging fear that she wasn’t ready to fully let him in.
She could feel herself holding back, but she didn’t know how to stop. She could
sense the intensity between them growing, and it scared her. It was more than
just attraction—it was a connection that went beyond words. And that kind of
connection was dangerous.
One evening, as the tension between them continued to grow, Kush texted her
again.
Kush (text): “Can we talk? I feel like we’re both running from something.”
Rhea stared at the text for a long time before she replied.
Rhea (text): “I’m not running, Kush. I just… I don’t know how to do this.”
The reply came quickly.
155 | P a g e
156


Kush (text): “I’m not asking for anything you’re not ready to give. I just want to
be honest with you. That’s all.”
She stared at the screen, feeling her heart race. She had wanted honesty, hadn’t
she? She had wanted to stop hiding from her feelings. But now, when the truth
was staring her in the face, she wasn’t sure if she was ready to embrace it.




Scene 4: A Confession
The next day, Rhea met Kush again, this time in a quieter part of campus, near
the old library. It was their place for serious conversations, a spot where they
could speak freely without the distractions of the world.
Kush was already there when Rhea arrived. He stood up as she approached, his
expression serious, but there was a tenderness in his eyes.
Kush (softly): "Rhea, I don’t want to complicate things. But I also can’t pretend
that I’m okay with just being friends. I care about you. A lot."
Rhea felt a lump form in her throat. This was it. The moment she had been
avoiding. The moment where the walls she had carefully constructed around
herself were finally coming down.
Rhea (barely above a whisper): "I care about you too. More than I want to admit.
But... it feels like I’m betraying Meera. Like this—whatever this is—shouldn’t
be happening."
Kush (softly): "You’re not betraying her, Rhea. Not when everything between us
feels this real."
He took a step closer, his voice steady but gentle.
Kush: "So, what now?"
Rhea took a deep breath. She didn’t know what came next. She didn’t know
how to navigate the uncertainty of her feelings, or what this connection between
them meant or will she be able to answer Meera once she finds out. But for the
first time in a long while, she felt ready to face it.
Rhea (with a small smile): "I guess we figure it out together."


156 | P a g e
157


Scene 5: The Promise of Tomorrow
The day ended with the two of them walking side by side, lost in conversation.
It wasn’t about what would happen next or how things would unfold—it was
about the moment they shared, the quiet understanding between them.
As they reached the campus gates, Rhea stopped and turned to him.
Rhea (smiling softly): "You know, I never thought I’d find someone like you."
Kush (grinning): "And I never thought I’d meet someone who makes me want
to be a better version of myself."
They stood there for a moment, the world around them fading as they simply
looked at each other. Neither of them had all the answers, but for the first time,
they didn’t need them. They had each other, and that was enough.
Rhea was no longer afraid of what the future might hold. Whatever happened,
she knew that they would face it together. And for the first time in a long time,
she felt at peace.




157 | P a g e

                Chapter 26: The Weight of Silence


Scene 1: A Familiar Quiet
The campus had grown quieter over the past week. As final exams loomed
closer, the once-bustling university grounds now felt more like a ghost town.
Students hurried between buildings, books in hand, their faces tense with the
weight of deadlines. Yet, amidst the rush, Rhea found herself drawn to the
stillness that now marked her life. It was as if everything around her had blurred,
leaving only her thoughts and the spaces where Kush existed.
Rhea sat by the same café window, watching the evening sky bleed into shades
of purple and gold. She was alone this time. It had become her ritual, to come
here in the late afternoons, away from the chaos of study groups and exam
preparations. Alone, with only her thoughts and a cup of coffee to keep her
company. But recently, the loneliness had felt different, more profound.
She couldn’t help but wonder if she was losing herself in the quiet.
As she stirred her coffee absentmindedly, her phone buzzed with a message
from Kush.
Kush (text): “Hey, how are you holding up with the exams? Want to meet after?
We could go for a walk or something.”
Rhea smiled softly, her fingers hovering over the screen as she read the message
again. There was a certain comfort in his words, a familiarity she had grown to
crave. She didn’t want to admit it, but she looked forward to these small
moments with him. It was as if, for a little while, the weight of the world would
lift whenever he was around.
Rhea (text): “I’m okay. A walk sounds nice.”
She sent the message, then leaned back in her chair, her gaze drifting back to the
street outside. She didn’t realize how much she needed this connection until it
was already part of her routine.




158 | P a g e
159


Scene 2: The Unexpected Encounter
Later that evening, Rhea met Kush at the usual spot. It was quiet now, the
campus almost empty, with only the occasional student rushing by. The crisp
evening air had a cooling effect, perfect for the short walk they had planned.
Kush was waiting near the fountain, his hands in his jacket pockets. As soon as
he saw her approach, he gave a small wave, his face lighting up in that familiar
smile that Rhea had come to love.
Kush (teasing): "You’re late. I was starting to think you’d forgotten about me."
Rhea rolled her eyes but couldn’t help the small smile that tugged at her lips.
Rhea: "You wish."
They walked side by side, the familiar silence between them a comfortable one.
The kind of silence that didn’t need words to fill it, but spoke volumes
nonetheless.
As they walked through the campus grounds, Rhea felt a shift in the air. There
was something unspoken between them, something that neither of them dared to
voice. But it was there, lingering, just beneath the surface.
Kush (glancing at her): "You know, I’ve been thinking… about us."
Rhea’s heartbeat quickened, and she glanced at him, not sure if she wanted to
hear what he had to say. There was always a nervous excitement when he spoke
like this—like he was about to open a door she wasn’t sure she was ready to
walk through.
Rhea (hesitant): "What about us?"
Kush (quietly): "I don’t know. I just… I don’t want to keep pretending that this
is just some casual thing. There’s more here. I can feel it. Can you?"
Rhea’s breath caught in her throat. His words hit her like a wave, unexpected
and powerful. She had been trying to push these feelings away, trying to
convince herself that it was all just a passing phase. But now, with his
confession hanging in the air, she couldn’t deny it any longer.
She stopped walking, turning to face him. The tension in the air thickened, as if
the world around them had disappeared, leaving just the two of them standing
there, caught in a moment they couldn’t escape.


159 | P a g e
160


Rhea (softly): "I don’t know, Kush. I don’t know if I’m ready for this. For you."
His gaze softened, and he took a small step closer, closing the space between
them.
Kush (gently): "You don’t have to be ready. I’m not asking for anything right
now. I just want to be honest with you, Rhea. I care about you."
The words hung in the air, heavy with meaning. Rhea felt her heart skip a beat,
and for a moment, she was at a loss for words. She had never expected him to
feel this way, never imagined that he could see something in her that she
couldn’t even see in herself.
But before she could respond, her phone buzzed, pulling her back to reality.
Rhea (looking at her phone): "Sorry, I—"
Kush (interrupting, with a soft smile): "No need to apologize. You don’t have to
have all the answers right now. We’ll figure it out."
Rhea nodded, a wave of gratitude washing over her. For the first time, she felt
like she didn’t have to rush into anything. There was no pressure. No
expectations.




Scene 3: A Shared Moment
As the evening wore on, Rhea and Kush continued their walk, the weight of the
conversation lingering in the quiet space between them. The stars were just
beginning to appear, dotting the darkening sky above them.
They stopped by the old tree near the campus courtyard, where they had often
met to talk, and leaned against it, watching the night unfold.
Kush (breaking the silence): "You know, I think we’ve spent so many years
trying to figure out who we’re supposed to be that we’ve forgotten how to just
be."
Rhea turned to look at him, her expression softening as she took in his words.
Rhea (thoughtfully): "Maybe we just need to stop worrying about the ‘what
next’ and live in the moment."


160 | P a g e
161


Kush (nodding): "Exactly. We’re both so scared of what’s coming that we forget
to appreciate what we have right now."
They sat there for a long while, their conversation meandering from topic to
topic, but always circling back to the same thing—the unspoken connection
between them.




Scene 4: A Difficult Choice
A few days later, Rhea found herself once again facing the inevitable clash of
emotions. Her friends noticed the shift in her mood, the subtle change in the
way she spoke about Kush. It wasn’t the casual indifference she had once shown
when talking about relationships. There was something different now,
something deeper.
But Rhea didn’t know how to articulate what was happening inside her. She had
spent so long building walls around her heart that it was hard to imagine them
coming down now. What if it was too late? What if she was too broken to be
with someone like Kush?
One evening, she sat in the quiet of her room, scrolling through her phone,
when another message from Kush popped up.
Kush (text): "I miss you."
The words were simple, but they made her heart ache. She missed him too,
more than she was willing to admit.
But what did that mean? Was she ready to risk everything for something that
could easily slip through her fingers? Could she let herself fall for him, knowing
how much it could hurt if things didn’t work out?
She stared at the screen for a long moment, the message hanging in the air like a
question she didn’t know how to answer.




161 | P a g e
162


Scene 5: A New Beginning
Rhea met Kush again the following evening. This time, there was no talk of
uncertainty, no hesitations. They had both come to realize that, while their
futures were uncertain, their present was undeniable.
As they stood at the edge of the campus, the world around them glowing with
the last rays of sunlight, Rhea finally spoke the words she had been holding
back.
Rhea (softly): "I’m scared, Kush. But I want to try. I want to see where this
goes."
Kush’s eyes lit up with a quiet joy, and he reached for her hand, threading his
fingers through hers.
Kush (smiling): "We don’t have to know where it’s going, Rhea. We’ll just
figure it out together."
For the first time, Rhea felt like maybe, just maybe, she wasn’t alone in this
after all.

                Chapter 27: The Echoes of the Past


Scene 1: A Shift in the Winds
The days following Rhea’s confession felt like a blur of emotion. She was no
longer the same person who had walked into the café weeks ago, unsure of
herself and hesitant to open her heart. Now, there was a sense of quiet certainty
in her—though it was still fragile, like a glass vase balanced on a windowsill.
One gust of wind, and it could all come crashing down.
She found herself replaying her conversation with Kush in her mind over and
over, wondering if she had made the right choice. It was strange, this feeling of
wanting something so badly, yet being terrified of it at the same time.
Her friends noticed the change in her, the subtle smile on her lips when she
mentioned Kush's name, the way she had started spending more time away from
the group, and how her gaze seemed distant when she wasn’t talking. They
knew something had shifted, but they didn’t ask her about it. Not yet.
One evening, as Rhea and her friends gathered at their usual spot in the campus
courtyard, the topic of relationships came up.
Ananya (grinning): "So, Rhea, any updates on your ‘mystery guy’? You’ve been
awfully quiet about him."
Rhea laughed, the sound light and carefree, but there was a flicker of hesitation
in her eyes.
Rhea (teasing): "No updates. What makes you think there’s anything to update?"
Priya (raising an eyebrow): "Oh please, we all know you're not the type to keep
a secret, especially when it comes to a guy you like."
Rhea looked down at her phone, pretending to text, but she could feel her heart
racing. How could she explain to them that everything had changed? That what
had once seemed like a casual friendship with Kush was now something deeper?
Something that she wasn’t ready to fully comprehend herself?
Rhea (softly): "I’m just figuring it out, that’s all."

Her friends exchanged looks, sensing there was more she wasn’t saying, but
they let the conversation die, respecting her silence.




Scene 2: The Unexpected Visit
The next day, Rhea decided to take a break from the overwhelming pressure of
finals and meet up with Kush. It wasn’t that she was avoiding her studies—she
had just reached a point where her thoughts were consumed by him. It had
become impossible to focus when his presence lingered in her mind, even in the
most mundane moments.
When she arrived at the café, she was surprised to see Kush sitting alone at their
usual table, his gaze lost in a book. His presence felt like a calming balm to her
frayed nerves, and for the first time in weeks, she didn’t feel the weight of the
world on her shoulders.
Rhea (approaching the table): "You’re early today."
Kush looked up, his smile lighting up his face. There was something different
about him too—something that told Rhea he wasn’t just pretending to be fine.
He was, in fact, as tangled up in their unspoken connection as she was.
Kush (with a grin): "I couldn’t help it. I had some time to kill."
Rhea sat down opposite him, and for a moment, they just stared at each other,
the words unspoken but understood. It felt like the air between them was
charged with something electric, something that neither of them could deny
anymore.
Rhea (breaking the silence): "Kush, I’ve been thinking a lot… about us."
His eyes widened slightly, as if bracing for something heavy, but he didn’t
interrupt her.
Rhea (hesitant): "I’m scared. I’m scared because I know this… whatever this is,
is important. But I don’t know how to make it work. I’ve always pushed people
away. I’ve always been the one to keep my distance."
Kush (softly): "You don’t have to be scared, Rhea. I’m not asking for anything
more than this. We don’t need to have everything figured out right now. We can
take our time."
164 | P a g e
165


Rhea felt a wave of relief wash over her, but it was tempered with the nagging
fear that maybe, just maybe, she wasn’t capable of love. Not in the way he
needed it.
Rhea (whispering): "But what if I can’t give you what you deserve?"
Kush reached across the table, his hand brushing lightly against hers. There was
a softness in his touch, an understanding that transcended words.
Kush (quietly): "You’ve already given me more than enough, Rhea."
For a moment, the rest of the world disappeared. It was just the two of them, in
this small café, suspended in time.




Scene 3: A Glimpse of the Past
The conversation shifted, from uncertainty to laughter, as they began discussing
random topics—college, their favorite movies, and childhood memories. Rhea
felt lighter than she had in days, the weight of her internal struggles
momentarily forgotten. But deep down, she knew that the issues she was
grappling with were far from resolved.
As they talked, an elderly woman walked into the café, catching Rhea’s
attention. The woman was carrying a small, weathered bag and had an air of
quiet wisdom about her. She moved slowly, but her eyes were sharp, observing
everything around her.
Rhea watched her for a moment, noting how the woman smiled softly at the
barista behind the counter before taking a seat at the corner table. There was
something strangely comforting about her presence, a reminder of the simplicity
of life and how little time people truly took to appreciate the small things.
As if on cue, the woman’s eyes met Rhea’s, and she offered a warm, knowing
smile. Rhea felt a strange shiver run down her spine, like a quiet connection had
been made between them, something unspoken.
Rhea (softly to Kush): "Do you ever think about the things we miss? The little
moments we forget to appreciate?"
Kush, who had been watching her quietly, nodded slowly, his expression
thoughtful.
165 | P a g e
166


Kush (softly): "I think we’re both doing that right now. Taking a moment to
appreciate… this."
Rhea smiled, a quiet understanding passing between them.




Scene 4: The Calm Before the Storm
Later that evening, Rhea sat in the library, surrounded by the chaos of final
exam preparations. Her mind, however, was far from the textbooks in front of
her. It was consumed with thoughts of Kush, the warmth of his hand in hers, the
way his words made her feel understood, even when she couldn’t understand
herself.
Nina pulled a chair beside Rhea and interrogated:
Nina: "Are you actually studying, or are you just staring at that page, hoping it
will magically make sense?"
Rhea looked up, her face flushing slightly.
Rhea (grinning): "I’m studying… kind of."
Nina (laughing): "You know, you’re really bad at pretending. Just admit it.
You’re thinking about someone."
Rhea rolled her eyes, trying to hide her smile.
Rhea (defensive): "I’m not. I’m just… distracted."
Nina (with a knowing look): "If you’re talking about Kush, just admit it. We all
see the way you look at him."
Rhea’s heart skipped a beat, and she didn’t know how to respond. Instead, she
chose to remain silent, focusing back on the book in front of her.
Nina (teasing): "Well, just don’t go too crazy over it. You’ve got exams,
remember?"
Rhea laughed, but it was half-hearted. She wasn’t sure if it was the exams or her
emotions that felt like they were starting to overwhelm her. She couldn’t quite
decide.


166 | P a g e
167


Scene 5: The Promise
The next day, Rhea met Kush again, and this time, it was different. She felt like
she had something to prove, not to him, but to herself. She had to find a way to
reconcile the person she had been with the person she was becoming. She
needed to stop pretending she wasn’t affected by him.
As they sat under the old tree, the one that had witnessed so many of their
conversations, Rhea looked at him, her eyes more determined than before.
Rhea (firmly): "I don’t know what’s going to happen with us, Kush. But I’m
willing to find out. I don’t want to run away from this anymore."
Kush smiled, his eyes lighting up with a mixture of joy and relief.
Kush (softly): "We’ll figure it out, Rhea. Together."
And for the first time, Rhea truly believed it.

Rhea sat by her window, staring at the lanes below, her thoughts a tangled mess.
How many times had she told herself this wasn’t real, that there was no her and
Kush? Yet, every moment they shared seemed to defy her logic, pulling her
deeper into a connection she couldn’t ignore. She found herself caught in a
perpetual state of disbelief—how could something so natural feel so wrong?
The questions plagued her, leaving her trapped in a constant dilemma, torn
between the loyalty she owed Meera and the undeniable pull she felt toward
Kush. Even now, she couldn’t figure it out, the weight of her indecision pressing
heavily on her chest.

                Chapter 28: The Quiet Chaos


Scene 1: The Weight of Uncertainty
The days following Rhea’s decision to explore her feelings for Kush were filled
with moments of quiet reflection. As much as she wanted to believe that
everything was moving toward something beautiful, there was a nagging voice
inside her that warned her of the fragility of their connection. She had never
been one to take risks with her heart, and now, as she found herself becoming
more entwined with Kush, she couldn’t help but wonder if she was setting
herself up for disappointment.
One afternoon, while walking across campus, Rhea ran into her best friend Nina.
They hadn’t spoken much in the past few days, as Rhea had been preoccupied
with the whirlwind of emotions tied to her feelings for Kush.
Nina (grinning): "You’ve been acting a little weird lately, Rhea. You know, more
than usual."
Rhea (laughing softly): "Weird how?"
Nina (teasing): "Like you’ve got a secret you’re not telling me. You’ve been
avoiding me, and the look on your face when I bring up anything about boys—"
Rhea cut her off, pretending to be defensive.
Rhea (playfully): "What do you mean? I don’t know what you’re talking about."
But Nina’s teasing smile faded into something more serious, as if sensing the
shift in Rhea’s demeanor.
Nina (softly): "It’s okay, Rhea. You can talk to me, you know."
Rhea didn’t know how to respond. She wanted to confide in Nina, wanted to tell
her everything that had been happening with Kush, but a part of her hesitated.
There was still so much she didn’t understand herself, and she wasn’t ready to
share it with anyone—especially not someone who knew her so well.
Rhea (hesitant): "I don’t know if I can, Nina. I’m still figuring it out."



168 | P a g e
169


Nina nodded, her eyes filled with understanding, but she didn’t push any further.
Instead, she placed a hand on Rhea’s shoulder and gave her a small, reassuring
squeeze.
Nina (softly): "Whenever you’re ready."




Scene 2: The Unseen Distance
The weeks passed in a blur of emotions, and Rhea found herself in a constant
state of flux. She spent more time with Kush, but every interaction left her
feeling conflicted. There were moments when they seemed perfectly in sync,
their conversations effortless and natural. But then, there were times when an
invisible wall seemed to come between them—when she would catch him
looking at his phone, or when he would withdraw into silence, leaving Rhea
wondering if there was something he wasn’t saying.
One evening, as they sat together at their usual café, the silence between them
was palpable. Kush had been quiet for most of their time together, his gaze fixed
on the window, and Rhea felt the familiar pang of uncertainty creeping in.
Rhea (gently): "Kush, what’s going on? You’ve been so distant lately."
Kush’s eyes flickered to hers, and for a moment, he seemed to hesitate, as if
weighing something in his mind. Finally, he let out a deep sigh, running a hand
through his hair.
Kush (softly): "I’m not sure what I’m doing, Rhea. I feel like I’m not being fair
to you. I’m still figuring things out, and I don’t want to drag you into something
that’s not clear."
Rhea’s heart sank. She had been preparing herself for this moment, but hearing
it aloud made it feel all the more real.
Rhea (quietly): "I never asked for anything from you, Kush. I just... I just
wanted to know where we stood."
Kush’s expression softened, and he reached across the table, his hand brushing
lightly against hers.



169 | P a g e
170


Kush (gently): "I know. And I’m sorry if I’ve made you feel uncertain. But I
think I need some time to figure things out. I don’t want to make any promises
I’m not sure I can keep."
Rhea nodded, her throat tight with emotion. She didn’t know what she was
expecting, but it wasn’t this. She had thought they had something special,
something that couldn’t be put into words—but now, it felt like she was
grasping at something intangible, something that was slipping through her
fingers.




Scene 3: The Convergence of Paths
The next few days were filled with a sense of unease. Rhea continued to see
Kush, but their interactions had become more awkward, filled with unspoken
words and unresolved tension. She began to wonder if their bond had ever been
as strong as she had believed, or if it was simply an illusion—a fleeting moment
in time that had burned bright and then quickly faded.
But just as she was starting to lose hope, something unexpected happened.
One afternoon, as Rhea was walking across campus, she spotted Kush sitting on
the steps near the library, deep in conversation with a group of friends. For the
first time in weeks, he looked at ease, laughing and joking with them. Rhea’s
heart skipped a beat, and she couldn’t help but feel a pang of jealousy.
But then, something shifted within her. She realized that she was no longer
angry or hurt—she was simply tired. Tired of waiting, tired of wondering if this
was worth it. She had given so much of herself to the idea of them, and now it
felt like she was standing at a crossroads, unsure of which direction to take.
As she passed by, Kush caught sight of her and smiled, but Rhea didn’t stop.
She didn’t want to be the person who clung to something that wasn’t real
anymore. She had always believed that love, when it was meant to be, would
find its way. But now, she wasn’t so sure.




170 | P a g e
171


Scene 4: A Change in Perspective
Later that evening, Rhea found herself sitting on the rooftop of her apartment,
staring out at the city below. The cool evening air washed over her, and she
closed her eyes, allowing herself to breathe deeply. She had been so focused on
the idea of love, on finding something that would fill the emptiness she had
carried for so long. But now, she wondered if she had been looking for
something that didn’t exist.
It wasn’t that she didn’t care about Kush—it was the opposite. She cared too
much. And maybe that was the problem. She had spent so much of her life
protecting herself, building walls around her heart, that she didn’t know how to
let someone in without feeling like she was losing control.
As she sat there, lost in thought, a message from Nina pinged on her phone.
Nina (text message): "Hey, just wanted to check in on you. I know things have
been weird lately, but I’m here for you. Always."
Rhea smiled softly, grateful for her friend’s unwavering support. She had always
been the one to keep everyone at arm’s length, to hide behind her walls. But
maybe, just maybe, it was time to let them down.
Rhea (text message reply): "Thanks, Nina. I think I’m starting to figure things
out."




Scene 5: The Quiet Resolution
The following day, Rhea made a decision. It wasn’t a dramatic moment, nor was
it a grand gesture. It was quiet, internal—a resolution to let go of the weight she
had been carrying. She knew that love, if it was meant to be, would come in its
own time. But for now, she needed to focus on herself.
When she saw Kush later that afternoon, she felt no desire to confront him, no
need to ask for answers. She had come to realize that the only person she
needed to answer to was herself. And with that realization, she felt a sense of
peace settle over her.
Kush approached her, his smile tentative, unsure of how to proceed.


171 | P a g e
172


Kush (tentatively): "Rhea, I’ve been thinking about everything we talked about.
And—"
Rhea (cutting him off gently): "I think we both need some time, Kush. Not just
for us, but for ourselves too. I need to figure things out, and I think you do too."
He nodded, his expression softening with understanding.
Kush (quietly): "I get it. I really do."
As he walked away, Rhea felt a strange sense of closure. It wasn’t a happy
ending, but it was an honest one. And for the first time in a long time, Rhea felt
like she was on the right path—no longer searching for love outside of herself,
but learning to embrace it within.




172 | P a g e
173



        Chapter 29: At the Crossroads of Hearts


Scene 1: Meera’s Realization
It had been a few days since Rhea made her decision to take a step back and
focus on herself. It wasn’t easy, but there was a strange sense of peace that
followed. Meanwhile, across town, Meera was dealing with her own storm of
emotions. As the days passed, she couldn’t ignore the heaviness that had settled
in her heart, a weight she had been carrying for far too long.
Meera had always been the one who kept up appearances. She laughed when
she needed to, smiled when the situation called for it, and wore her happiness
like an armor. But underneath it all, she was crumbling. There was a sadness
within her, a quiet, lingering ache that she hadn’t allowed herself to
acknowledge. And it wasn’t just the tension with Kush—it was everything.
As she sat on the edge of her bed, looking out the window, her mind wandered
back to the days when things had felt simpler. When she and Kush had first
started dating, everything had seemed so effortless. But somewhere along the
way, their connection had faded. The late-night phone calls had turned into
silence, the sweet gestures had turned into obligations, and now, Meera was left
wondering if she had ever really known him at all.
She had tried to ignore it at first, telling herself that things would improve, that
time would fix whatever was broken. But now, she couldn’t deny it anymore—
she was unhappy. The love she had once felt for Kush seemed distant, and in its
place was a hollow emptiness. She wasn’t sure what had caused the shift, but
the truth was undeniable.
Sitting with her phone in her hands, she scrolled through old pictures of her and
Kush. Smiling faces, happy moments. But when she looked at them now, all she
saw was a version of herself who had been pretending to be okay.
Meera let out a shaky breath, her heart heavy with realization. Maybe she had
been too afraid to confront the truth, too afraid to admit that she had been
holding on to something that wasn’t meant to be.



173 | P a g e
174


But what hurt the most was the guilt. She knew that Kush wasn’t happy either.
They were two people stuck in a relationship that no longer served them, and
yet, they both continued to pretend. Pretend that everything was fine. Pretend
that they could keep up the facade of a perfect couple.
Meera (whispering to herself): "What are we doing, Kush?"
Her voice cracked with emotion, and for the first time in a long while, Meera
allowed herself to feel the sadness. She had spent so long pushing her feelings
down, convincing herself that everything would be fine. But now, it was all
unraveling, and she didn’t know how to stop it.




Scene 2: Kush’s Struggle
Kush sat in the same café, the one where he and Rhea had shared countless
conversations. The same place where he had felt so connected to her—where
the world had felt simple and unburdened by doubts. But now, as he sat alone,
the world seemed more complex than ever.
He hadn’t heard from Meera in days. Their interactions had been curt, the
silences between them growing longer with each passing day. Kush knew that
something was wrong, but he didn’t know how to fix it. It wasn’t like they had
fought. It was more subtle than that. The distance between them wasn’t born
from anger—it was born from a lack of understanding, a growing realization
that they were no longer on the same page.
Kush had always been the kind of person who wore his emotions on his sleeve,
but lately, he found it harder to keep up the facade. He was tired of pretending
to be happy. He was tired of pretending that things were fine when they weren’t.
He knew that he had been distant with Rhea, and in doing so, he had also been
distancing himself from Meera. She deserved more than what he could give her
right now, but he couldn’t seem to find the courage to admit that to her. To
admit that they were both stuck in a relationship that was no longer fulfilling for
either of them.



174 | P a g e
175


He sat there, staring at the half-empty cup of coffee in front of him, feeling the
weight of his thoughts. There was a part of him that wanted to reach out to
Meera, to try and fix things. But another part of him knew that it might be too
late. And maybe, just maybe, it was time for both of them to let go.
Kush (whispering to himself): "I’m sorry, Meera. I don’t know how to fix this."




Scene 3: Rhea’s Journey of Self-Discovery
While Meera and Kush were unraveling in their own ways, Rhea found herself
in a different place altogether. She had made the decision to stop searching for
love outside of herself, to stop waiting for something that might never come. It
wasn’t easy—she still thought about Kush, still wondered about what could
have been. But in her heart, she knew it was time to focus on her own growth,
on finding herself without relying on anyone else for validation.
It wasn’t that she had given up on love—it was that she had realized she needed
to be whole on her own before she could ever share her life with someone else.
She was still young, still figuring things out, but for the first time, she felt at
peace with where she was.
Rhea spent more time with Nina, exploring new interests, rediscovering old
passions, and focusing on her writing. She had always been a writer at heart, but
lately, she had found herself writing more than ever. It was her therapy, her way
of processing everything that had been going on in her life. She had begun to
write about her experiences with love, with loss, and with the struggle to
understand herself.
She wrote about Kush, of course—he was a part of her story. But she also wrote
about her own journey, about how she was learning to be okay with not having
all the answers. She was learning to embrace the uncertainty, to find beauty in
the chaos.
One evening, while sitting in the library, Rhea’s fingers hovered over the
keyboard. She had just finished writing a chapter about self-discovery, about
learning to love herself first before she could love anyone else. And as she read
over her words, she realized how far she had come.
Rhea (to herself, smiling softly): "I’m not lost anymore."

175 | P a g e
176


Scene 4: The Crossroads
As the weeks passed, the three of them—Rhea, Kush, and Meera—found
themselves at a crossroads, each struggling with their own internal battles. But
while their paths had diverged, there was one thing they all shared: the
realization that love was complicated. It wasn’t a fairytale. It wasn’t something
that could be forced. It was messy, unpredictable, and often painful.
Meera began to face the truth that her relationship with Kush was no longer
what it had been. She knew that the time had come to let go. It was the hardest
decision she had ever made, but deep down, she knew it was the right one.
Kush, on the other hand, realized that he had been running from his own
feelings, from the truth of what he wanted and needed. He didn’t know what the
future held, but he knew that he couldn’t continue living in uncertainty.
And Rhea? She was finding peace in her own journey. She didn’t know what
was next for her, but for the first time in her life, she felt content with where she
was. She didn’t need anyone else to define her happiness. She was finally
learning to embrace it within herself.

                Chapter 30: Unwritten Futures


Scene 1: The Study Sessions
As the final year approached, Rhea, Ananya, and Nina found themselves
balancing their academic responsibilities with the need to stay grounded. The
days were long, filled with endless hours of study and group projects. Rhea,
determined to end her college journey on a high note, put all her energy into her
studies. The pressure was immense, but she had grown stronger over the years,
understanding the importance of time management and self-discipline.
Late-night study sessions became routine, with Ananya and Nina by her side,
their coffee cups ever-present as they tried to stay awake and focused.
Ananya (laughing softly): “Remember when we used to struggle with the first
few chapters of macroeconomics? Now look at us.”
Rhea (grinning): “Yeah, we’ve come a long way.”
But it wasn’t just academics that defined their final year. It was also about the
friendships they had cultivated—those connections that had stood the test of
time.
Nina: “Can you believe it's almost over? Our last exams are just around the
corner.”
Ananya (with a nostalgic smile): “It feels surreal. Time has flown by so fast.”
They spent their last few weeks in college together, working hard but cherishing
every moment of camaraderie, making the most of the time they had left.




Scene 2: The Exam Days
The countdown to the final exams had begun. Rhea sat at her desk, her
textbooks and notes scattered around her. The weight of the coming days rested
heavily on her shoulders, but she remained focused. Each day felt like a mini
battle, but Rhea knew she was capable of handling it.


177 | P a g e
178


The morning of the first exam, Ananya sent a quick text:
Ananya: "You ready? Let’s ace this!"
Rhea smiled, feeling the comfort of her friends' support. They had always been
a source of strength, and now, as they faced the culmination of their college
journey, it was clear that they were in it together.
As they walked into the exam hall, Nina remarked: "Let’s give it our best shot,
no regrets."
And they did. Each exam was a challenge, but Rhea had the unwavering belief
that she could face whatever came her way.




Scene 3: Kush’s Journey
On the other side, Kush was navigating his own path. He had stepped away
from the chaos of his personal life to immerse himself in a project close to his
heart—sustainable farming. Kush had always been passionate about nature and
the environment, and now, he was actively working toward making a difference.
Though he hadn’t been in touch with Rhea for some time, his thoughts often
wandered to her. He had seen the changes she’d gone through, her evolution
from someone unsure of herself to the confident, focused individual she was
now. There were moments when he missed her—when he thought about their
time together, how things had once felt so effortless.
But life had a way of pulling him in a different direction. His focus on
sustainable farming, his studies, and his personal growth kept him busy. Yet,
Rhea’s absence left an inexplicable gap in his life, one that he didn’t know how
to fill.
Kush (to himself): “I wonder how she’s doing. Is she still the same? Or has she
moved on completely?”
But the thoughts would fade as quickly as they appeared, buried under the
weight of his responsibilities.




178 | P a g e
179


Scene 5: The Quiet Moments
As the evening sky shifted from vibrant hues of orange and pink to a soft
lavender, Rhea found herself sitting on one of the stone benches beneath a large
tree at the edge of the campus. The bustling energy of the day had calmed, and
the once-crowded courtyard had emptied, leaving behind only a few straggling
students finishing late-night study sessions or heading home after a long day.
The cool breeze rustled the leaves above her, creating a soothing backdrop to
her thoughts.
Rhea rested her elbows on her knees, her hands clasped loosely together, as she
gazed across the vast lawns of SOS University. The once unfamiliar campus
now felt like home in so many ways. The change had come slowly, with each
small step she’d taken—each new experience, every class, every conversation
with a friend, and each personal challenge she had overcome. It all added up to
this moment of quiet reflection.
She thought back to when she first arrived here, how uncertain and lost she had
felt. The nervousness, the self-doubt that had plagued her thoughts as she
adjusted to this new life, seemed so far away now. She had learned to navigate
not just the university, but herself. The girl who had once hesitated at every
choice, afraid of making the wrong one, had evolved into someone who could
confidently stand on her own, face the unknown, and take on whatever the
future might bring.
Rhea thought about the people she had met—Nina, Ananya and all the other
friends she had made along the way. They had each taught her something
different. Nina had shown her what true friendship meant, how it was about
lifting each other up and creating memories that could last a lifetime. Ayaan had
reminded her of the importance of humor and not taking life too seriously.
Ananya on the other hand, how to be carefree about lil things, Priya, smile at
every possible things. And even the quiet moments with Kush, though still
undefined, had made her realize that sometimes, it wasn’t just about where you
were going, but who you were with along the way.
She glanced down at her phone, which was buzzing with notifications from her
parents and friends back home, but she didn’t feel the usual rush to reply.
Instead, she closed her eyes for a moment, feeling the weight of everything she
had gained and let go. She had let go of her fear, her doubts, and the constant
pressure to be perfect. In exchange, she had embraced growth—personal,

179 | P a g e
180


academic, emotional. She had found a balance between ambition and self-care,
between pursuing her dreams and taking the time to enjoy the small moments.
The future still loomed ahead of her, undefined and full of possibility. There was
so much she still wanted to do—write more, understand the intricacies of
economics better, maybe even travel to experience new cultures and ideas. But
one thing was certain: Rhea was no longer afraid of what was to come. She had
faced her insecurities, learned from them, and was now standing taller for it.
Her journey wasn’t over—she knew that. But she was no longer waiting for
something to change. She had already started the process of transformation. It
was in the way she walked through the campus with her head held high, in the
way she carried herself with a quiet confidence, and in the way she spoke her
mind. She had already begun to carve out the future she wanted, one day at a
time.
Rhea smiled softly, her heart light. The path ahead might still be filled with
twists and turns, but she was ready to face whatever came her way. She had
already started her journey of self-discovery—and the best part was, she knew
there was so much more to come.




Scene 6: The Final Push
The final exams were over, and Rhea, Ananya, Priya and Nina sat together in
their favorite café, the same place where they had spent countless hours
studying and sharing their thoughts over coffee. The pressure of the past few
weeks had lifted, but the uncertainty of the results hung heavy in the air.
Rhea stirred her coffee absentmindedly, her mind racing with thoughts about
what came next.
Ananya: “Can you believe it’s over? No more exams, no more all-nighters. It’s
like we’ve crossed a finish line, but now we’re just waiting for the verdict.”
Rhea (with a small smile): “Yeah, it feels weird. Like we’ve done everything we
can, but the results are still out of our hands.”
Nina: “I’m just hoping I pass. But beyond that, I have no idea what’s next.
Maybe some internship? I’m still figuring it out.”

180 | P a g e
181


Ananya (nodding): “Same here. I think I might look for how to be an economist,
but I don’t know if it’ll be the right fit. I’ve got a few thoughts in mind, but...”
Rhea leaned back in her chair, her thoughts drifting to something she had been
considering for a while now.
Rhea: “I’ve been thinking... I’m not really looking for a typical job right now. I
think I want to focus on writing. I’ve always wanted to write a book, and now
seems like the right time.”
Ananya (raising an eyebrow): “A book? That’s amazing! What kind of book?”
Rhea (sipping her coffee): “I’m not exactly sure yet. But it’s something I feel
strongly about. It could be about all the things we’ve been through, or maybe
just about the journey of finding yourself. I don’t know. But I’ve been writing
for a while now, and I think I want to pursue it more seriously.”
Nina: “Wow, that’s actually pretty cool. I love how you’re following what
you’re passionate about, Rhea. You’ve always been so true to yourself.”
Rhea (smiling): “Thanks. It’s not going to be easy, but I think it’s worth trying.
And even if it doesn’t turn into anything right away, I’ll at least have given it
my best shot.”
The conversation shifted to other topics, but Rhea’s mind remained on the idea
of her book. The exams were over, the future was uncertain, but for the first
time in a long while, Rhea felt like she was on the right path. She didn’t know
what her future held, but she knew that pursuing her writing was something she
had to do, no matter what.

                Chapter 31: The Last Goodbye


Scene 1: Graduation Day
The day had finally arrived—the culmination of years of hard work, late nights,
early mornings, and countless memories. It was graduation day. The campus,
once a place of stress and uncertainty, now felt like a blank canvas for the future.
The sun was shining brightly, and the atmosphere was filled with excitement
and nostalgia. Students were running around in their caps and gowns, posing for
pictures, exchanging hugs, and preparing for the day’s ceremonies. Rhea stood
in front of the university building, looking at the bustling scene, feeling both
overwhelmed and exhilarated.
It had been a long journey, but today, everything felt right. She had come so far,
grown so much, and in her heart, she knew that this was the start of a new
chapter. As she adjusted the cap on her head and smoothed the folds of her
gown, Rhea thought back to how much had changed over the past few years—
how much she had changed.
Her life had been a whirlwind. The ups, the downs, the relationships, the
moments of doubt, and the occasional breakthroughs. And through it all, she
had found herself. She had found a sense of peace within, a clarity that had
eluded her in the past. No longer searching for love outside of herself, she had
embraced who she was—imperfect, yet whole.
But today, as she stood there, she couldn’t help but think about the people who
had been with her along the way—the people who had shaped her journey. Most
importantly, she thought of Kush and Meera. It was strange, thinking about
them both now, as the years had passed, and yet, they all still felt so connected,
like a thread that had never fully broken.
Rhea smiled to herself, taking a deep breath. It was time for one last meeting—
one last goodbye.




182 | P a g e
183


Scene 2: The Meeting
The campus was abuzz with energy, but amid the chaos, Rhea found herself
drawn to the old café, the one where she and Kush had shared so many
conversations. It was the place where everything had started. As she walked in,
she saw familiar faces scattered across the tables. Some were students, some
were professors, all of them here for the same reason—celebrating the end of
one journey and the beginning of another.
Rhea’s eyes scanned the room, and then she saw them—Kush and Meera. They
were sitting at the same table, the one where they had all once sat together. It
had been a while since they had all been in the same room, and Rhea felt a mix
of emotions stir inside her.
Kush, dressed in his graduation gown, was looking down at his phone, while
Meera sat across from him, her eyes scanning the room, but they immediately
met Rhea’s gaze when she entered. There was a moment of silence—just a brief
second where everything paused, and in that moment, everything felt like it was
meant to be.
Rhea smiled warmly and walked over to them. Kush looked up first, and the
faintest of smiles appeared on his face. Meera followed suit, standing up and
giving Rhea a hug.
Rhea: “It’s good to see you both.”
Meera (smiling): “You too, Rhea. It feels like so much time has passed.”
Kush (nodding): “Yeah, it’s crazy. Time really flies.”
They all sat down, and for a moment, there was an awkward silence. There was
no tension, no hard feelings—just a strange feeling of things having changed.
Rhea could tell that both Kush and Meera had grown, just as she had. They were
no longer the same people who had once been caught up in their own mess of
emotions.
Rhea (breaking the silence): “So… this is it, huh? Our last day as students.”
Kush (laughing): “Yeah. It feels surreal. Like one big chapter is closing, but
another is starting. It’s kind of exciting, in a way.”
Meera (softly): “It’s scary, though. All this uncertainty. But I guess it’s part of
the journey.”

183 | P a g e
184


Rhea nodded, reflecting on her own thoughts. She had spent so much time
wondering about what was to come, about what her life would be like after
graduation. But now, in this moment, she realized that the future wasn’t
something to fear—it was something to embrace. She had learned that she
didn’t have to have all the answers. Life would unfold as it should.




Scene 3: A Walk Down Memory Lane
The three of them decided to take a walk around the campus after their coffee.
They passed by the familiar spots where they had spent countless hours—sitting
on the steps of the library, the grassy area where they had studied together, and
the old courtyard where they had attended so many events. Each place held a
memory, a piece of their shared history.
Kush (looking around nostalgically): “Remember when we first met here? I
think I almost tripped over my own feet when I saw you.”
Meera (laughing): “You were so nervous! I couldn’t stop laughing.”
Rhea (smiling): “I remember that. You were both such an awkward mess.”
They all laughed, the sound echoing in the quiet afternoon. It felt like the weight
of the past had finally been lifted. There were no more unresolved feelings, no
more bitterness—just a peaceful acceptance of the journey they had all been on.
As they walked, they shared stories of what they had been up to since their time
at university. Meera had decided to pursue a career in marketing, something she
had always been passionate about. She had found joy in helping brands connect
with people, and it was something that felt right for her. Kush had chosen to
work with a non-profit organization, focusing on providing educational
opportunities to underprivileged children and something with sustainable
farming side by side as he was passionate about that too. It was a cause close to
his heart, and he was excited to make a difference. And as for Rhea, she had
decided to follow her dream of becoming a writer, something she had been
working on in her spare time and also follow her passion for economics. She
had even started a blog, where she shared her thoughts, stories, and experiences
with the world.



184 | P a g e
185


The more they talked, the more Rhea realized how far they had all come. They
had changed so much, each of them growing into their own person, finding their
own paths. And while their journey together had come to an end, they would
always be a part of each other’s stories.




Scene 4: The Farewell
As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the campus, the group stood
together, taking in the view. The future was still uncertain, but in this moment,
they were content.
Rhea (softly): "I don’t think I ever really thanked you all. For being there for me,
for helping me become who I am."
Meera (smiling): "You don’t have to thank us, Rhea. You did all the hard work
yourself."
Kush (grinning): "We were just along for the ride."
Ananya (with a soft chuckle): "Honestly, I feel like I’m going to miss our late-
night talks. Especially with all the chaos that was going on. You two always had
the best advice."
Nina (looking down, her tone softer): "I just want to say, I’m really grateful for
you all. These years... it’s been a lot. But I’ll never forget how we supported
each other."
Priya (smiling warmly): "Exactly. We’ve all been through so much, but we’re
still standing together."
Rhea (turning to Meera, her voice soft with sincerity): "Meera... I just want to
apologize. I never wanted to come between you and Kush. That was never my
intention, and I’m really sorry if I caused you any hurt. You’ve always been a
good friend to me, and I hope you know that."
Meera (nodding, her smile warm but bittersweet): "It’s okay, Rhea. We’re all
learning and growing. Nothing’s ever simple, but that’s just how life is."
Kush (giving a gentle smile): "Yeah, and you didn’t come between us. We were
always figuring things out. We all are."


185 | P a g e
186


Rhea (smiling with a hint of relief): "Thank you, Meera. I really didn’t mean to
make things harder between us. I hope we can still be friends."
Meera (nodding): "Of course. We’ll always be friends, Rhea."
Rhea (with deep sincerity, looking at Nina): "Nina, I want to thank you. I know
things were complicated, but you’ve been by my side when I needed you the
most. You’ve been such a good friend, and I’m grateful for you."
Nina (visibly touched): "Rhea…"
Rhea (smiling): "I just want you to know that, no matter what happened, you
mean a lot to me. You've been there for me when I was unsure of so much.
Thank you for not leaving when I needed someone the most."
Nina (softly): "You’ve always had my back too. No matter what happens, I’ll
always be here for you."
Rhea (smiling softly): “I’ll miss this.”
(After a moment of silence, Meera looks at Rhea and then at Kush, and with a
casual tone, gestures for a moment alone with them.)
Meera (looking at Rhea): “Hey, Rhea, could I talk to you for a minute? Just a
quick word.”
Rhea (slightly surprised, but nods): “Of course, Meera.”
(Meera and Rhea step aside, while the others continue to chat in the
background. After a few moments, Meera then calls out to Kush.)
Meera (to Kush, with a soft smile): “Kush, can I have a quick word with you
too?”
Kush (curious but agreeing): “Sure, Meera. What’s up?”
(Meera leads Kush a little further away from the group, both of them unaware
of what’s to come.)




Scene 5: A Call to Home
Rhea walked a little away from the group, finding a quiet corner near the
campus gate. The sound of distant chatter faded as she dialed her parents'

186 | P a g e
187


number, her heart swelling with anticipation. It rang twice before her mother’s
voice came through.
Rhea’s Mom (excitedly): “Rhea! How are you, sweetheart?”
Rhea (grinning): “I’m good, Mom. Actually, I’m with some friends, but I just
wanted to call and let you know how everything went.”
Rhea’s Dad (in the background): “The convocation, Rhea! How was it?”
Rhea (smiling): “It was perfect, Dad. I graduated today.”
Her parents immediately broke into joyful exclamations.
Rhea’s Mom (proudly): “Oh, Rhea! We knew you’d do it! We are so proud of
you. Tell us everything, how was it?”
Rhea paused for a moment, taking in the weight of the day.
Rhea: “It feels surreal, honestly. I’ve been waiting for this moment for so long,
and now that it’s here, it feels like a dream. But it also feels like a new chapter is
starting.”
Rhea’s Dad (with a warm chuckle): “That’s our girl—always looking ahead.
We’re so proud of you, sweetheart.”
Rhea: “Thanks, Dad. I couldn’t have done it without both of you. I’m really
thankful for all your support.”
Rhea’s Mom (gently): “You’ve worked so hard for this, Rhea. You deserve
everything that comes your way.”
Rhea’s Dad: “And what about your next steps, Rhea? What are you thinking?”
Rhea (pausing): “Well, I’ve started working on a blog, after sorting things out
will start applying for interviews and maybe apply for an MBA further and I’ve
been writing professionally too. It feels right—finally following what I love to
do.”
Rhea’s Mom (delighted): “That’s wonderful, sweetheart! We’re so proud of you
for pursuing your passion. I knew you’d get there.”
Rhea (with a soft laugh): “It feels like it’s all falling into place. It’s scary but
exciting at the same time.”



187 | P a g e
188


Rhea’s Dad (with a smile): “We’re behind you all the way, Rhea. You’ve got
this, and we can’t wait to see what comes next for you.”
Rhea (with a grateful smile): “Thanks, I can’t wait to come home and tell you
more in person.”
Rhea’s Mom (teasing): “We can’t wait to see you, too. Just don’t forget us when
you’re out there making it big!”
Rhea (laughing softly): “I won’t, Mom. I promise.”
After a few more words of love and encouragement, Rhea said her goodbyes.
She hung up the phone, her heart full, feeling both grounded and ready for the
journey ahead.

Chapter 32: The Boy, When The Heart Speaks -
                 The Debut


The room was abuzz with excitement, a steady hum of conversation filling the
air as fans gathered to meet Rhea at her book signing event. The sleek interiors
of the bookstore reflected her journey—calm, composed, and full of promise.
The large banner overhead read:
"Meet the Author: Rhea Agarwal - Signing Copies of The Boy – When The
Heart Doesn’t Speak”
Rhea sat behind the polished wooden desk, a stack of her books neatly arranged
beside her. Each fan came with bright eyes and a story to share, their enthusiasm
contagious. She smiled warmly at every face, her pen moving effortlessly across
the title pages as she signed her name.
Fan 1 (A young woman, smiling knowingly):
“I loved how you portrayed Rhea and Kush in the end. They were so different,
yet they found their way back to each other. It was beautiful! I really hoped they
end up together.”
Rhea (smiling warmly, feeling a bit bashful):
“Thank you so much! It means a lot that you connected with their journey.
Sometimes life does have a way of bringing people back together when they
least expect it.”
Though her smile never faltered, Rhea’s thoughts began to drift. This day, this
moment had been a long time coming. She had poured her heart into The Boy,
not realizing how much of herself she had written into its pages. It was more
than just a book; it was a mirror of her experiences, of her deepest fears and
hopes.
Rhea (thinking): He’ll come when he can. I know he will.
Fan 2 (A college student, excited):
“Honestly, I couldn’t stop rooting for Rhea and Kush. I love that even though

189 | P a g e
190


they went through so much, they came back to each other in the end. I think
that’s what makes the story real.”
Rhea (grinning):
“I’m so glad you felt that way. Sometimes we just need to let go and trust that
things will work out when the time is right.”
Fan 3 (An older woman, tearfully):
“I was so happy when Rhea and Kush found their way back to each other. It
gives hope that even in the hardest times, love can still find its way.”
Rhea (softly, with a grateful look):
“Thank you for saying that. It’s a reminder that love isn’t always
straightforward, but it’s worth fighting for.”
Fan 4 (A curious reader, a little hesitant):
“Is… is this your story? Rhea and Kush, I mean. Did you really go through
something like this?”
Rhea (pausing for a moment, then laughing softly):
“Well, let’s just say there are pieces of me in Rhea, but it’s a work of fiction.
While I can relate to her journey, the rest is a product of my imagination. But I
guess, in some ways, it’s a little bit of me on every page.”


The line of fans continued, each interaction adding to her growing sense of
pride. She had done it—she had built something meaningful. Yet, a part of her
wished Kush could be here to share in this moment.
Suddenly, a familiar voice broke through the chatter, catching her completely
off guard.
Kush: “Well, if it isn’t my talented wife stealing all the limelight!”
Rhea’s pen froze mid-signature as her head snapped up. There he was, standing
a few feet away, a mischievous grin on his face. He looked as dashing as ever in
his crisp white shirt and dark blazer, his eyes sparkling with amusement.
Rhea: “Kush?!”
He stepped forward, ignoring the whispers and curious glances from the crowd.
Kush (grinning): “Miss me?”


190 | P a g e
191


Rhea: “What are you doing here? You said your trip wouldn’t end until next
week!”
Kush: “What kind of husband would I be if I missed my wife’s big day?
Besides”—he leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a playful whisper—“I had
to see if The Boy was really about me.”
Rhea’s cheeks flushed, a mix of surprise and embarrassment washing over her.
Rhea (stammering): “I... it’s not... I mean, parts of it...”
Kush laughed, the sound rich and warm, before straightening up.
Kush: “Relax, wifey. I’m just teasing.”
The crowd around them watched with interest, murmuring among themselves.
Some recognized Kush, others simply enjoyed the display of affection.
Fan 3 (whispering): “That’s her husband? He’s gorgeous!”
Rhea tried to compose herself, shooting him a mock glare.
Rhea: “You’re causing a scene, Kush.”
Kush: “Good. It’s your day, and I want everyone to know how proud I am of
you.”
The sincerity in his voice melted her frustration. She reached out, squeezing his
hand briefly before returning to her fans.
Kush stayed by her side for the rest of the event, quietly supporting her as she
continued signing books. Occasionally, he would whisper a comment or joke,
making her laugh and easing her nerves.
As the event wound down, Rhea leaned back in her chair, exhaustion mingling
with happiness.
Kush: “Tired?”
Rhea: “A little. But this... this was worth it.”
Kush: “You’re incredible, you know that? Watching you today... it’s like seeing
you in your element.”
Rhea (smiling softly): “I’m just glad you’re here.”
Kush: “Always, Rhea. Always.”


191 | P a g e
192


As they packed up for the evening, Rhea couldn’t help but feel that this day
marked more than just the launch of her book. It was a celebration of how far
she had come—not just as a writer, but as a person. And with Kush by her side,
she felt ready for whatever came next.


As the crowd continued to thin, Rhea was still caught in the whirlwind of
emotions from Kush’s surprise appearance. Just as she was catching her breath,
a familiar group of voices broke through the noise, and she turned to see her
closest friends walking toward her—Meera, Nina, Priya, Ananya, Arjun, Ayaan,
and her parents, along with her mother and father-in-law.
Meera (smiling warmly): "Well, look who’s the star of the show now!"
Rhea’s eyes brightened as she took in the sight of her friends, each of them
radiating pride and joy. Her heart skipped when she saw her parents standing
beside them, her mother’s smile wide with pride and her father’s face glowing
with the same admiration. The realization of how many people were there for
her in this moment overwhelmed her.
Rhea (laughing): "You guys really came all the way here for this?"
Ananya (grinning): "Of course we did! We couldn’t miss this moment. And look
at you, Rhea—our bestselling author!"
Nina (with a wide smile): "This is incredible, Rhea. The Boy is everywhere. It’s
amazing to see how far you’ve come!"
Priya (teasing): "You always knew you were meant for this. I’m just glad I got
to witness the rise of a literary legend!"
Arjun (grinning): "From your worst critic to your biggest fan, I’m all in. You’ve
made it."
Ayaan (chuckling): "This is just the start, Rhea. I’ve always known you had
something special."
Meera (softly but with a knowing smile): "You’ve done it, Rhea. I’m so proud
of you."
Rhea felt a deep warmth in her chest, her friends’ unwavering support making
the achievement feel even more meaningful. But what truly touched her was the


192 | P a g e
193


presence of her parents, who were beaming with pride, as if this achievement
were their own. Rhea turned to them with a smile that couldn’t be contained.
Ananya (playfully): "Okay, okay, I’m still waiting for my free signed copy, but
that’s beside the point. I knew you’d end up with Kush. Honestly, how could I
not see it? You two were always meant to be."
Rhea (blushing slightly, rolling her eyes): "You were so sure, huh?"
Ananya (teasing): "I mean, after all the umpty-billion times you swore off love,
I had to be right sooner or later!"
Rhea (with a smile, glancing at Kush): "Yeah... I guess love has its own timing,
even if I didn’t believe it would come for me."
Meera (gently): "You deserve it, Rhea. I’m just glad I got to witness your
journey. You’ve come so far, and I knew you'd find your way."
Rhea (grinning): "It feels unreal, Meera. All of this—having everyone here,
having all of you supporting me. It means the world."
Kush, who had been standing by quietly, walked over and wrapped an arm
around Rhea’s shoulder, a proud smile on his face.
Kush (playfully): "Well, since we’re all sharing stories of how we knew what
was going to happen… I think it’s safe to say I knew this moment was coming."
Ananya (teasing): "Oh, now the husband is claiming he knew first. Sure, Kush.
Sure."
Rhea (laughing): "Alright, alright, enough from both of you!"
After a few more laughs, the group gathered for a group photo, everyone
laughing and joking as they posed together. The happiness in the room was
contagious, and Rhea couldn’t help but feel like this moment was everything
she had ever hoped for—and more.
As the event slowly wrapped up, each friend took a moment to congratulate
Rhea once more.
Nina (hugging Rhea): "This is just the beginning, Rhea. You’ve made it, and I
can’t wait to see what’s next."
Arjun (smiling): "A bestselling author, huh? I see you. So proud of you."



193 | P a g e
194


Priya (playfully): "Next book launch, we need a bigger venue! You’re going to
need it!"
Ayaan (giving a thumbs up): "You’ve got this, Rhea. Keep going."
Ananya (hugging Rhea tightly): "I always knew you had it in you. I’m so
proud."
Meera (with a smile): "You did it, Rhea. You really did it."
Rhea turned to her parents, her heart full. They had been her biggest supporters
throughout her journey, and seeing them here, sharing this moment with her,
made everything feel even more special.
Rhea (smiling warmly): "I’m so glad you could be here. How are you both
liking everything?"
Her mother smiled, her eyes twinkling. "It’s perfect, sweetheart. We’re so proud
of you. And it’s wonderful seeing you surrounded by so many people who care
about you."
Her father added, his voice full of pride, "This is just the beginning for you,
Rhea. I’m glad we could be here today."
Rhea (with a chuckle): "It really means a lot to have you both here with me.
How are you staying? Where are you all staying?"
Her mother exchanged a glance with her father, a knowing smile shared
between them. "We’re staying together, of course," her mother said softly.
"We’re all staying at our son Kush’s house. It's nice to have everyone under one
roof again."
Rhea’s heart warmed as her gaze shifted to Kush, who was smiling proudly. He
had always been supportive of her, and now it felt like everything was coming
full circle. Her parents, her friends, and Kush—this was the family she had
created, and it felt complete.
Kush (softly): "You did amazing today. I’m so proud of you."
Rhea (smiling at him): "Thank you for being here, for everything."
Together, they left the bookstore, the soft hum of the evening air surrounding
them as they walked into the next chapter of their lives, hand in hand, with their
families and friends close by, ready for whatever the future held.

       Epilogue: The Love Once Misunderstood


(After a moment of silence, Meera looks at Rhea and then at Kush, and with a
casual tone, gestures for a moment alone with them.)
Meera (looking at Rhea): “Hey, Rhea, could I talk to you for a minute? Just a
quick word.”
Rhea (slightly surprised, but nods): “Of course, Meera.”
(Meera and Rhea step aside, while the others continue to chat in the
background. After a few moments, Meera then calls out to Kush.)
Meera (to Kush, with a soft smile): “Kush, can I have a quick word with you
too?”
Kush (curious but agreeing): “Sure, Meera. What’s up?”
(Meera leads Kush a little further away from the group, both of them unaware
of what’s to come.)
(After a brief pause, Meera looks back at Rhea and Kush, her expression
shifting to one of calm seriousness.)
Meera (to both): "Hey, I think we should meet at that café down the street.
There’s something important I need to talk to both of you about."
Rhea (slightly puzzled but intrigued): "Sure, Meera. What’s going on?"
Kush (nodding): "Alright, we’ll meet you there."
(With that, Meera gestures for them to follow, and they all agree to meet at the
café for the conversation that feels important, though neither of them is entirely
sure what to expect.)


The soft hum of the city outside contrasted with the quiet, intimate atmosphere
of the café. It was the same place where Rhea had met Meera months ago,
though this time, the mood was different. The tension that had once defined
their interactions was replaced by a strange sense of camaraderie.



195 | P a g e
196


Rhea sat across from Meera, the steam from their cappuccinos curling upward
like unspoken words. Kush, who had arrived a little earlier, stood nearby,
leaning against the counter, his expression unreadable. His presence was a
surprise to Rhea, and she couldn’t help but wonder why Meera had insisted he
join them.


Meera: “You’re probably wondering why I asked you both to meet.”
Rhea (softly): “A little, yes.”
Kush remained silent, his gaze darting between the two women. Meera smiled
faintly, her expression no longer guarded.
Meera: “I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately. About Kush, about myself...
about us.”
Rhea stiffened slightly at the mention of Kush, but Meera’s tone wasn’t
accusatory. It was reflective, almost apologetic. She glanced briefly at Kush
before continuing.
Meera: “You know, I wasn’t blind to what was happening. I could see there was
something between you two. At first, I was angry. Hurt. I thought you two
were... sneaking behind my back. But then... I read those texts.”
Rhea’s breath hitched. Her eyes widened in alarm as she turned to Kush, who
looked just as startled.
Rhea (quickly): “Meera, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean for you to find out like that.
I never wanted to—”
Meera raised a hand, stopping her mid-sentence.
Meera: “It’s okay, Rhea. I was upset when I first saw them. But the more I read,
the more I realized... it wasn’t what I thought. You weren’t plotting or trying to
hurt me. You were confused, scared, and... so careful. Too careful.”
Kush shifted uncomfortably but said nothing. Rhea glanced at him, their eyes
meeting briefly. A silent apology passed between them.
Meera: “What struck me the most was how much you both tried to deny it. To
fight what was clearly there. And yet, in every word, I could feel it—the
connection. The way you two understand each other, support each other, even in
silence. It’s something Kush and I never had.”
196 | P a g e
197


Rhea looked down, her fingers tightening around her cup.
Rhea (hesitantly): “Meera, I swear I never wanted to come between you two.
I—”
Meera: “I know, Rhea. That’s the thing. You didn’t have to try. It just...
happened. And honestly? I don’t blame you. I blame myself for holding on to
something that wasn’t meant to be.”
Kush opened his mouth to speak but seemed to think better of it. His gaze
lingered on Meera, gratitude mixed with regret.
Meera: “I wasn’t blind before your birthday or previously the meeting for the
road trip either. I didn’t come on purpose. Remember how you guys danced at a
party by… by someone I don’t remember. Anyways, you guys just looked
perfect?”
Rhea’s head snapped up in surprise.
Meera: “I wanted you two to have time together. To figure things out. I knew I
was holding Kush back, and that wasn’t fair to either of us. So, I stepped aside.”
Rhea blinked, her mind racing to process Meera’s words. The idea that Meera
had orchestrated moments for her and Kush to bond felt surreal.
Rhea (whispering): “You did that... for us?”
Meera (smiling faintly): “Yes. Because I could see what you both couldn’t. You
belong together. And holding on to something that was already broken wouldn’t
fix it.”
Kush finally spoke, his voice thick with emotion.
Kush: “Meera, I... I’m sorry. For everything.”
Meera (gently): “Don’t be. We both tried, Kush. We gave it our all. But
sometimes, love isn’t about fighting for what’s familiar. It’s about letting go and
making space for what’s real.”
Rhea’s eyes filled with tears, her chest tightening with a mix of guilt and
gratitude.
Rhea (softly): “I don’t know how to thank you.”
Meera: “You don’t have to. Just promise me one thing.”


197 | P a g e
198


Rhea: “Anything.”
Meera: “Don’t waste this. Don’t let fear or doubt keep you from being happy. If
you and Kush are meant to be, then give it everything you’ve got.”
Rhea nodded, her throat too tight to speak. She glanced at Kush, who was
already looking at her, his eyes filled with a quiet determination.
Meera (standing up): “Take care of each other, okay? And... take care of
yourselves.”
As she walked away, leaving Rhea and Kush alone in the café, the weight of her
words settled over them. For a moment, neither spoke, the silence filled with
unspoken emotions.
Finally, Kush broke the silence.
Kush (softly): “She’s right, you know.”
Rhea looked at him, her heart pounding.
Kush: “We can’t keep running from this.”
Rhea nodded slowly, her voice trembling.
Rhea: “Then let’s stop running.”
They shared a small, hopeful smile, the first of many steps toward something
new, something real.

                            The Present

The memory played out vividly in Rhea’s mind as she and Kush walked hand in
hand back to their car after the book signing event.
Kush (teasing): “You still haven’t told me if The Boy is about me.”
Rhea (rolling her eyes): “You’re never going to let this go, are you?”
Kush stopped, pulling her gently to face him.
Kush: “No, because I want to hear you say it.”
Rhea sighed, her cheeks flushing.
Rhea: “Fine. It’s about you. Are you happy now?”
Kush grinned, his expression softening as he leaned closer.
Kush: “Very. But you know what?”
Rhea: “What?”
Kush: “You’re the one who wrote our story. You’re the one who made me
realize what love really is.”
The memory shifted to that fateful conversation with Meera. The clarity, the
understanding—they had set the stage for what came next. Kush had been
hesitant, but when Meera had approached him, her words were resolute.
Meera: “You love her, Kush. You don’t need my permission, but... you have my
blessing.”
Kush: “Meera, I never wanted to hurt you.”
Meera: “And you didn’t. You just loved someone else. It happens. But now, you
have a chance to make it right. Don’t waste it.”


Rhea looked at Kush, his hand resting on hers as they drove back home.
Rhea (thinking): He chose me. We chose each other. And that’s all that matters.

As the car sped through the city, Rhea felt an overwhelming sense of peace. She
had found her place, her purpose, and her person.

Chapter 33: Love Sealed in Everyday Moments


Scene 1: An Awaited Morning
The first rays of sunlight spilled through the sheer curtains, casting a warm glow
across the bedroom. Rhea stirred in bed, her eyes fluttering open to find Kush
sitting on the edge of the mattress, sipping his coffee and scrolling through his
phone.
Rhea (groggily): “You’re up early. Business calls?”
Kush turned to her, a soft smile lighting up his face.
Kush: “No calls today. I thought I’d make breakfast for you.”
Rhea raised an eyebrow, sitting up and wrapping the blanket around herself.
Rhea: “Breakfast? You mean toast and butter?”
Kush (laughing): “Hey, I’ve leveled up. There might even be scrambled eggs
involved.”
Rhea smiled, watching him as he disappeared into the kitchen. This was what
their life had become—simple, unpretentious moments that felt like the truest
form of love.




Scene 2: The Surprise
Rhea wandered into the living room later that morning, drawn by the sound of
Kush humming a familiar tune. He was setting the table, plates arranged neatly
alongside two cups of freshly brewed coffee.
Kush: “Sit. Breakfast is served.”
Rhea (teasing): “I’ll be the judge of that.”
She took a bite of the eggs and looked up at him, a mock-serious expression on
her face.

Rhea: “Not bad, Mr. Husband. You might just have a future as a chef.”
Kush (grinning): “Don’t get used to it. This is a one-time event.”
Rhea laughed, the sound filling the room like music.
Kush: “By the way, I have something for you.”
Rhea’s eyes widened as Kush pulled out a small velvet box from his pocket.
Rhea: “Kush, what is this?”
Kush: “Just open it.”
Inside the box was a delicate gold bracelet, engraved with the words Always
With You.
Rhea (whispering): “Kush, this is beautiful.”
Kush took her hand, slipping the bracelet onto her wrist.
Kush: “You’ve always been my constant, Rhea. Even before we were... us. I just
wanted you to have something to remind you of that.”
Rhea felt her heart swell, her eyes misting over.
Rhea: “You didn’t have to do this.”
Kush: “I wanted to. For you.”




Scene 3: The Walk Down Memory Lane
Later that day, they found themselves strolling through the park where they had
first met. The air was crisp, filled with the scent of blooming flowers and the
distant laughter of children.
Rhea: “Do you remember that day? When you spilled coffee all over my
manuscript?”
Kush (chuckling): “How could I forget? I thought you were going to murder
me.”
Rhea: “I wanted to. But then you made it up to me by staying up all night to
retype it.”

Kush stopped walking, turning to face her.
Kush: “I didn’t just do it to fix the mistake, you know. I did it because I wanted
to spend more time with you. Even then, you had this... pull. Like gravity.”
Rhea looked at him, her eyes reflecting the depth of her emotions.
Rhea: “I guess we’ve come a long way from spilled coffee and awkward
apologies, haven’t we?”
Kush: “We have. And I wouldn’t change a single moment of it.”
They continued their walk, the past blending seamlessly with the present, each
memory a testament to the journey they had shared.




Scene 4: The Evening Under the Stars
That night, they sat on the balcony of their apartment, a bottle of wine between
them and the city lights stretching out like a sea of stars.
Rhea: “Do you ever think about the future? About where we’ll be in ten years?”
Kush: “All the time. But honestly, as long as you’re in it, I don’t care where we
are.”
Rhea leaned her head on his shoulder, the warmth of his presence wrapping
around her like a blanket.
Rhea: “You’re such a sap, you know that?”
Kush (laughing): “And you love it.”
Rhea smiled, closing her eyes.
Rhea (whispering): “Yeah, I do.”
The night stretched on, quiet and peaceful, filled with the kind of love that
didn’t need grand gestures or dramatic declarations. It was the kind of love that
lived in the small moments, the ones that made life worth living.

Scene 5: The Quiet Reflection
The city lights shimmered like scattered jewels, their reflections dancing in the
wine glasses on the balcony table. Rhea sat alone for a moment, the cool
evening breeze lifting a few strands of hair, sending a soft chill through her. The
night felt calm, its stillness a sharp contrast to the hustle of the city below. The
faint hum of traffic, barely noticeable, was the only reminder of the world
continuing around her. It was comforting, almost peaceful, like the universe had
paused just for her, giving her space to breathe and reflect.
She leaned back in her chair, letting the quiet envelop her as she reached for her
bracelet. The simple gold piece glinted in the moonlight, the engraving Always
With You catching her eye. She traced the words with her fingertips, feeling a
sense of grounding she hadn’t realized she needed. The bracelet was a gift from
Kush, a symbol of their unspoken bond. It had been through all the ups and
downs, much like their friendship, always there in moments of joy and sorrow.
Her thoughts drifted, carried away by the memories of a time when life had
seemed so much more uncertain. She remembered her dorm room, the late-night
talks with Priya and Ananya, the laughter that had filled the air, the inside jokes
they had created, and the bond that had solidified with every shared moment.
The memories were like a soft melody, one that brought both warmth and a
touch of sadness—because those days had passed, but their essence still lived
on in her heart. She could almost hear their voices now, as if they were still in
the room with her, their carefree laughter echoing in the space between past and
present.
Rhea smiled softly, her eyes closing for a brief moment as she savored the
feeling of gratitude that washed over her. She had come so far, hadn’t she? From
the girl who was uncertain, lost in the chaos of love and confusion, to the
woman she was now—stronger, wiser, and grounded in who she was. It wasn’t a
perfect journey, but it was hers.
The soft clink of a plate brought her back to the present, and she opened her
eyes to find Kush walking toward her, holding their dessert. He was smiling, his
eyes filled with warmth, and for a brief second, everything felt right. In the
distance, the twinkling city lights seemed to reflect their own quiet joy. It wasn’t
loud or extravagant—it was just them, together in this moment. And that was
enough.

She took a deep breath, grateful for the quiet reflection, for the stillness that
allowed her to be fully present in her life. The future was still uncertain, but
tonight, she was content.

       Chapter 34: Reminisces and Gratefulness


Priya: “My dad brought mom flowers today, just because. Can you believe it?
After 25 years of marriage!”
Ananya: “Aww, that’s so sweet. Honestly, I want love like my parents. They still
dance in the kitchen like teenagers.”
Rhea (rolling her eyes, laughing): “You guys are so cheesy. Love like that
doesn’t exist. It’s all just... performative.”
Priya: “You say that now, but one day you’ll bump into someone who makes
you eat your words. Mark my words, Rhea.”
Rhea (grinning): “If that ever happens, I’ll buy you a lifetime supply of
chocolate.”


Rhea smiled to herself, the memory washing over her like a warm wave. She
had been so cynical back then, convinced that love was an illusion, a fleeting
concept that never truly anchored anyone. But life had a way of surprising her,
of proving her wrong in the most unexpected ways.
She thought of Kush—the man who had walked into her life with nothing but
bumping into each other always, a clumsy apology, and a spilled coffee cup.
The man who had stayed through her moments of doubt, through her stubborn
need to prove she didn’t need anyone. And now, here she was, sharing her life
with him, her heart fuller than she ever thought possible.


Kush stepped back onto the balcony, holding two plates of chocolate mousse.
He set them down and took the seat next to her, pulling her close.
Kush: “You okay? You look like you’re a million miles away.”
Rhea (smiling): “Just... thinking.”
Kush: “About what?”


206 | P a g e

Rhea: “About how wrong I was. About love, about everything. I remember how
my friends used to talk about their parents—their love stories, their silly
traditions—and I never got it. I never thought I’d have that. But now...”
Kush (softly): “Now you do.”
Rhea turned to him, her eyes glistening under the starlight.
Rhea: “Yeah, now I do. And I’m so glad I was wrong.”
Kush leaned in, kissing her forehead gently, his arm wrapping around her
shoulders.
Kush: “You weren’t wrong, Rhea. You just hadn’t found the right person yet.
Now you have.”
Rhea rested her head on his chest, her heart brimming with gratitude and a quiet
joy. For the first time, she felt like she truly understood what her friends had
been talking about all those years ago.


As her memories panned out, Rhea imagined her younger self, sitting in the
dorm room with Priya and Ananya, rolling her eyes at their romantic tales. She
could almost hear them teasing her now, telling her how love had finally caught
up with her.
The city below sparkled, a mirror to the stars above, as Rhea closed her eyes,
letting herself sink into the moment.
Rhea (thinking): Sometimes, the most extraordinary love stories begin in the
most ordinary ways. And sometimes, the love you never believed in becomes the
love you can’t live without.
